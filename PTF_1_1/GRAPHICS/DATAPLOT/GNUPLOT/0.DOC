Package:	graphics/dataplot/gnuplot

Description:	gnuplot - an interactive plotting program

Version:	3.0

Notes:

  Gnuplot is a command-driven interactive function plotting program.

  If files are given, gnuplot loads each file with the load command, in the
  order specified.  Gnuplot exits after the last file is processed.

  Here are some of its features:

  Plots any number of functions, built up of C operators, C library functions,
  and some things C doesn't have like **, sgn(), etc.  Also support for
  plotting data files, to compare actual data to theoretical curves.

  User-defined X and Y ranges (optional auto-ranging), smart axes scaling,
  smart tic marks.

  Labelling of X and Y axes.

  User-defined constants and functions.

  Support through a generalized graphics driver for AED 512, AED 767, BBN
  BitGraph, Commodore Amiga, Roland DXY800A, EEPIC, EmTeX, Epson 60dpi
  printers, Epson LX-800, Fig, HP2623, HP2648, HP75xx, HPGL, HP LaserJet II,
  Imagen, Iris 4D, Kermit-MS, Kyocera laser printer, LaTeX, NEC CP6 pinwriter,
  PostScript, QMS QUIC, ReGis (VT125 and VT2xx), SCO Xenix CGI, Selanar, Star
  color printer, Tandy DMP-130 printer, Tek 401x, Tek 410x, Vectrix 384, VT
  like tekronix emulator, Unix PC (ATT 3b1 or ATT 7300), unixplot, and X11.
  The PC version compiled by Microsoft C supports IBM CGA, EGA, VGA, Hercules,
  ATT 6300, and Corona 325 graphics.  The PC version compiled by Turbo C
  supports IBM CGA, EGA, MCGA, VGA, Hercules and ATT 6300 graphics.  Other
  devices can be added simply, but will require recompiling.

  Shell escapes and command line substitution.

  Load and save capability.

  Output redirection.

  All computations performed in the complex domain.  Just the real part is
  plotted by default, but functions like imag() and abs() and arg() are
  available to override this.
