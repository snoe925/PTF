Description:	GNU graphics utilities

Version:	0.17

Notes:

  The GNU graphics utilities are a set of programs for plotting
  scientific data.  The program `graph' reads data files and writes a
  stream of plotting commands in a device independent format refered
  to below as a GNU plot file.  The remaining programs provide support
  for displaying GNU plot files on tektronix 4010, PostScript (TM)*,
  and X window system compatible output devices.

   `graph' reads both ascii and binary data files and writes a plot
  file with or without axes and labels.  You can specify labels and
  ranges for the axes, and you can set the sizes and position of the
  plot on the page.  Each invocation of graph produces a plot with
  single set of axes and data.  You can place an arbitrary number of
  plots on the page by concatenating the plot output of several
  invocations.

   `plot2ps' is a utility for converting plot files into PostScript. 
  The `plot2ps' utility reads plotting commands from named files or
  the standard input and writes PostScript to the standard output. 
  You can then print the PostScript output on a printer, or edit it
  using the `idraw' graphics editor.  You can also easily include the
  output in LaTeX documents using `dvips' and the LaTeX command `psfig'.

  Why is this useful? The plot file format is a common standard on
  un*x systems.  To produces figures for publication, you might need
  to take data sets, and produce labeled figures from them.  This can
  be done using `graph', `plot2ps' and the `idraw' editor.  You can
  also include these figures in LaTeX documents using the `dvips'
  utility.  All of these utilities, as well as the plot file format
  and plot library, are discussed in the following sections.
