Package:	graphics/library/vogle

Description:	VOGLE - Graphics Learning Environment

Version:	2.0

Notes:

  VOGLE (Very Ordinary Graphics Learning Environment) is a library of C
  routines for doing line drawings and polygon fills in 2 and 3 Dimensions.
  It handles circles, curves, arcs, patches, polygons, and software text in
  a device independent fashion.  Simple hidden line removal is also available
  via polygon backfacing. Access to hardware text and double buffering of
  drawings depends on the driver.  There is also a FORTRAN interface but as
  it goes through the C routines FORTRAN users are warned that arrays are
  in row-column order in C.  A SUN Pascal interface has also been provided.
