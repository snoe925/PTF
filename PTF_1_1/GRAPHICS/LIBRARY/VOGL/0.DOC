Package:	graphics/library/vogl

Description:	VOGL - Very Ordinary Graphics Library

Version:	?

Notes:

  VOGL is a library of C routines which try to allow a programmer to write
  programs which can be moved to machines which have the Silicon Graphics GL
  library on them.  It is based entirely on the VOGLE graphics library, and
  as a result can handle circles, curves, arcs, patches, and polygons in a
  device independent fashion.  Simple hidden line removal is also available
  via polygon backfacing.  Access to hardware text and double buffering of
  drawings depends on the driver.  There is also a FORTRAN interface but as
  it goes through the C routines FORTRAN users are warned that arrays are
  in row-column order in C.  Both the long FORTRAN names and the shortened
  six character names are supported.  People interested in using software
  text should see the hershey library, HERSHEY(3).
