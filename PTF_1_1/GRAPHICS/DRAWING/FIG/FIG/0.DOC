Description:	original Fig

Version:	2.1R1

Notes:

  Most V2.1 improvements were in fact implemented for V1.4 R3, which was never 
  actually released.  Please read README-V1.4R3 for details of these changes.
  After receiving Baron's code for Fig-FS 1.4 R3, I decided to upgrade it to a
  version which would be compatible with XFig Version 2.0.  This involved
  making small changes to the handling of text objects and area fill.

  Unfortunately, Fig code V2.0 as defined by Brian Smith in XFig has an
  irregularity in the definition of line objects which I have chosen to
  correct rather than perpetuate.  This makes the output format of this
  version Fig slightly incompatible with XFig 2.0, but I am hopeful that a
  compatible XFig 2.1 will soon be available.
