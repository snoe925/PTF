Description:	fig - Drawing Package

Notes:

  Fig (Facility for Interactive Generation of Figures) is a menu-driven tool
  that allows the user to draw and manipulate objects interactively on the
  screen of a Sun Workstation. It can only be run within the SunWindows
  environment and requires a three-button mouse.
  ...
  The output from fig can be translated into one of several graphics
  languages for printing or inclusion in troff(1) or TeX documents.
  These languages include pic(1), postscript, LaTeX pictures, and pictex or
  epic macros for TeX.  The preprocessors which implement these translations
  are part of the TransFig software package.
