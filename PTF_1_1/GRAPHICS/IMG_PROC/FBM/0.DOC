Package:	graphics/img_proc/fbm

Description:	FBM - Fuzzy PixMap library

Version:	1

Notes:

  This package allows manipulation and conversion of a variety of color
  and black-and-white image formats.

  Philosophy

    Each program can read any of the understood formats, and
    can write any of the understood formats that make sense for
    the image data.

    Programs are designed around specific image operations (sizing,
    scaling, retoning, halftoning, quantizing, etc.), rather than
    simply converting from one format to another.  For example,
    converting a 4bit color GIF file to a 1bit Sun rasterfile
    takes the following operations:
    
        read GIF format
        map color values to grayscale
        adjust aspect ratio (1.2 --> 1.0)
        scale image up to be visible (320x200 --> 640x480 or 1152x864)
        optionally sharpen the image (edge enhancement)
        optionally clean up "snow" in image (flip isolated pixels)
        halftone (Blue noise, Floyd-Steinberg, Jarvis, Threshhold)
        write Sun rasterfile format.

    So the equivalent pipeline of fbm routines would be:
    
    clr2gray < foo.gif | fbnorm | fbext [ args ] | fbhalf [args] > foo.1bit
    
    That way you have maximum control over the resulting image size
    and quality.
