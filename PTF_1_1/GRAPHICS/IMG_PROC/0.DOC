Description:	Image Processing Tools

Notes:

  Image processing  deals with the analysis and modification of existing
  images, generally from the "real world".  (Computer graphics, in contrast,
  involves the creation of an artificial image by some algorithmic means.)

  Image processing tools are used to convert the representation of images,
  perform arithmetic operations on pixels, display images, etc.  Display
  programs are typically constrained to run with particular display hard-
  ware and/or a particular window system.
