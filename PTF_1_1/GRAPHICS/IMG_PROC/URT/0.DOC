Description:	urt - Utah Raster Toolkit

Version:	3.0

Notes:

  The Utah Raster Toolkit is a set of programs for manipulating and composing
  raster images.  These tools are based on the Unix concepts of pipes and
  filters, and operate on images in much the same way as the standard Unix
  tools operate on  textual  data.  The Toolkit uses a special run length
  encoding (RLE) format for storing images and interfacing between the
  various programs.  This reduces the disk space requirements for picture
  storage and provides a standard header containing descriptive information
  about an image.  Some of the tools are able to work directly with the
  compressed picture data, increasing their efficiency.  A library of C
  routines is provided for reading and writing the RLE image format, making
  the toolkit easy to extend.
