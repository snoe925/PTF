Notes:

  Computer graphics involves the creation of an artificial image by some
  algorithmic means.  Image processing, a related discipline, deals with the
  analysis and modification of existing images, generally from the "real
  world".

  The main areas in representational computer graphics are modeling and
  rendering.  Modeling has to do with developing equations that describe the
  geometry and physics of a set of objects.  Rendering translates the scene
  description into an image, adding shading, texturing, light sources, etc.

  On a more mundane level, there are a variety of computer graphics programs
  for plotting data.  These typically produce line charts, pie charts, surface
  grids, etc.
