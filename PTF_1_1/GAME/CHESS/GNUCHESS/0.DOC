Description:	gnuchess - GNU Chess game

Version:	3.1

Notes:

  GNU Chess is a communal chess program. Contributors donate their
  time and effort in order to make it a stronger, better, sleeker program.
  Contributions take many forms: interfaces to high-resolution displays,
  opening book treatises, speedups of the underlying algorithms, additions
  of extra heuristics. These contributions are then distributed to the
  large user-base so that all may enjoy the fruits of our labor. The
  original and continuing purpose of this project is to permanently end 
  the rampant hoarding of computer chess software that has been the 
  case for the past 20 years.

  Many people have contributed to GNU Chess. Their contributions have
  improved the program from being a patzer (weak program) to being a
  grandpatzer (decently strong program). In its growth since initial
  release, GNU Chess has gone from approximately class D to strong
  master strength. It beats the Fidelity Mach 3 (USCF 2265) rather
  handily when run on a Sparc-1 (RISC). Since these types of RISC
  chips are becoming fairly common, the age of "master chess
  in your computer lab" is now a reality. From there, it will be a
  short hop to master chess in your home with FSF software.
