Package:	game/go/gnugo

Description:	gnugo - GNU Go game

Version:	1.1

Notes:

  This program is the updated version of Hugo (Version 1.0).  It is an
  attempt to start a free program to play Go.  The idea is based on the
  article "Programming the Game of Go. Byte, Vol.6 No.4" by J. K. Millen.

  Currently, this program only understands basic Go rules and play skills.
  It counts the number of liberty for each board piece.  Computer move is
  generated by choosing among several possible moves to attack the opponent,
  defense own pieces and match playing patterns.  If no good move is found
  then random move will be generated.  It doesn't have the concept of eye
  although it will try to form one.
