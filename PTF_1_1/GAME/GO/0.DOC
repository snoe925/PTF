Description:	The Game of Go

Notes:

  I am convinced that Go will gradually share with Chess the leading position
  among intellectual games in the Occident, just as it has reigned supreme in
  the Orient for the last three to four thousand years.  As a matter of fact,
  Go has actually replaced Chess as the favorite pastime of a great many
  people who are familiar with both games, particularly mathematicians and
  physicists.
