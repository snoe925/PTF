Description:	Game Programs

Notes:

  Computers have been used for games for quite a while.  The UNIX operating
  system, in fact, owes much of its existence to Ken Thompson's interest in
  writing a "space travel" game.  Many system administrators try to keep
  games off their systems, or at least under some degree of control.  This
  is generally counter-productive.  It annoys the users, and won't work if
  they are at all motivated.  Just make sure they get their work done, then
  relax...
