Package:	game/empire

Description:	BSD Empire

Version:	1.1

Notes:

  Empire falls into the broad category of simulation games and involves
  military, political, and economic factors.  Although no goal is explicitly
  stated, players rapidly derive their own, ranging from the mundane desire
  to be the biggest, mightiest country in the game and "conquer" all others
  to the more refined goals of having the most efficient land use possible
  or the lowest ratio of military to civilians while still surviving,
  etcetera.

  WHY USE A COMPUTER?

  The role of the computer in Empire is that of modeling the physical/economic
  system.  Players interact through the computer rather than with the computer.
  The game is played in a "real-time" environment; players log on and allocate
  resources, attack neighbors, send diplomatic communiques, etc. whenever it
  is convenient.  The program keeps track of these activities, maintaining a
  record of time spent and arranging for time to accumulate when players are
  not logged in to the game.
