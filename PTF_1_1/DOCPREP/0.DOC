Description:	Document Preparation Tools

Notes:

  Document preparation tools provide a variety of related functions, from text
  editing and formatting to error checking.  Because these tools are used a
  great deal, their users tend to get quite committed to them.  One thus hears
  "religious arguments" about the benefits and drawbacks of this or that tool.
  Try to avoid getting involved in such discussions; pick and use a tool,
  switch if you find a better one.
