Description:	CRISP - Programmers Editor

Version:	v2.2e

Notes:

  CRISP (Custom Reduced Instruction Set Programmers Editor) is a programmers
  editor containing many advanced features.  The following is just a small
  list of features available:

    Full color support and highlighting of blocks for copying and deleting.

    Full infinite levels of undo and redo.

    Multiple buffers and windows on screen.

    Multiple backups of files.

    Multiple named scrap buffers for cutting and pasting between buffers.

    C-like programming language allowing users to enhance and customise
    the functionality of the editor.

    Integrated access to external system programs, e.g.  C compiler,
    shells, etc.

    Scroll-locking two windows together to allow side by side file comparisons.

  Where ever possible, CRISP has no internal limitation on the number of
  files being edited, maximum line length, etc. CRISP is only limited by
  your machines memory and disk space limitations.

  In essence, CRISP combines some of the best features of other
  editors available, e.g. vi, emacs, BRIEF.
