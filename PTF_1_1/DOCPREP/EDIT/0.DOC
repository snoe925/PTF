Description:	Text Editors

Notes:

  Text editors are often confused with word-processing packages.  The
  distinction, in general, is that the latter provide formatting services,
  usually in a WYSIWYG (What You See is What You Get) fashion.

  Most UNIX editors will allow the user to format a ducument by means of a
  special command.  This is frequently just a UNIX command, however, and it
  does only monospace formatting.  To get a fully formatted document in a
  UNIX environment, you must invoke a formatting programm, such as TeX or
  troff  (or find a word processor).
