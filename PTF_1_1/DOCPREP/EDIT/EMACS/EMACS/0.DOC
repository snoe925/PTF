Description:	emacs - GNU Emacs

Version:	18.57

Notes:

  You are reading about GNU Emacs, the GNU incarnation of the advanced,
  self-documenting, customizable, extensible real-time display editor
  Emacs.  (The `G' in `GNU' is not silent.)

  We say that Emacs is a "display" editor because normally the text
  being edited is visible on the screen and is updated automatically as
  you type your commands. 

  We call it a "real-time" editor because the display is updated very
  frequently, usually after each character or pair of characters you
  type.  This minimizes the amount of information you must keep in your
  head as you edit.

  We call Emacs advanced because it provides facilities that go beyond
  simple insertion and deletion: filling of text; automatic indentation
  of programs; viewing two or more files at once; and dealing in terms
  of characters, words, lines, sentences, paragraphs, and pages, as
  well as expressions and comments in several different programming
  languages.  It is much easier to type one command meaning "go to the
  end of the paragraph" than to find that spot with simple cursor keys.

  "Self-documenting" means that at any time you can type a special
  character, `Control-h', to find out what your options are.  You can
  also use it to find out what any command does, or to find all the
  commands that pertain to a topic.
 
  "Customizable" means that you can change the definitions of Emacs
  commands in little ways.  For example, if you use a programming
  language in which comments start with `<**' and end with `**>', you
  can tell the Emacs comment manipulation commands to use those strings
  (*note Comments::.).  Another sort of customization is rearrangement
  of the command set.  For example, if you prefer the four basic cursor
  motion commands (up, down, left and right) on keys in a diamond
  pattern on the keyboard, you can have it.

  "Extensible" means that you can go beyond simple customization and
  write entirely new commands, programs in the Lisp language to be run
  by Emacs's own Lisp interpreter.  Emacs is an "on-line extensible"
  system, which means that it is divided into many functions that call
  each other, any of which can be redefined in the middle of an editing
  session.  Any part of Emacs can be replaced without making a separate
  copy of all of Emacs.  Most of the editing commands of Emacs are
  written in Lisp already; the few exceptions could have been written
  in Lisp but are written in C for efficiency.  Although only a
  programmer can write an extension, anybody can use it afterward.
