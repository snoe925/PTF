Description:	The LaTeX System

Notes:

  The LaTeX document preparation system is a special version of Donald Knuth's
  TeX program.  TeX is a sophisticated program designed to produce hi-quality
  typesetting, especially for mathematical text.  LaTeX adds to TeX a
  collection of commands that simnplify typesetting by letting the user
  concentrate on the structure of the text rather than on formatting commands.
  In turning TeX into LaTeX, I have tried to turn a highly-tuned racing car
  into a family sedan.  The family sedan isn't meant to go as fast as a racing
  car or be as exciting to drive, but it's comfortable and gets you to the
  grocery store with no fuss.  However, the LaTeX sedan has all the power of
  TeX hidden under its hood, and the more adventurous driver can do everything
  with it that he can with TeX.
