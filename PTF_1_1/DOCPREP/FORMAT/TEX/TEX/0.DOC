Description:	TeX

Notes:

  Gentle Reader: This is a handbook about TeX, a new typesetting system
  intended for the creation of beautiful books -- and especially for books
  that contain a lot of mathematics.  By preparing a manuscript in TeX
  format, you will be telling a computer exactly how the manuscript is to be
  transformed into pages whose typographic quality is comparable to that of
  the world's finest printers; yet you won't need to do much more work than
  would be involved if you were simply typing the manuscript on an ordinary
  typewriter.  In fact, your total work will probably be significantly less,
  if you consider the time it ordinarily takes to revise a typewritten
  manuscript, since computer text files are so easy to change and to
  reprocess.  (If such claims sound too good to be true, keep in mind that
  they were made by TeX's designer, on a day when TeX happened to be working,
  so the statements may be biased; but read on anyway.)
