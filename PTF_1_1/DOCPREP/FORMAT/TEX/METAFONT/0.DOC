Description:	The METAFONT System

Notes:

  METAFONT is a system for the design of alphabets suited to raster-based
  devices that print or display text.  The characters that you are reading
  were all designed with METAFONT, in a completely precise way; and they
  were developed rather hastily by the author of the system, who is a rank
  amateur at such things.  It seems clear that further work with METAFONT
  has the potential of producing typefaces of real beauty.  This manual has
  been written for people who would like to help advance the art of
  mathematical type design.
