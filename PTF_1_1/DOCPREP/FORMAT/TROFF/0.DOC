Description:	The Troff System

Notes:

  Both nroff and troff derive from roff, which in turn arose from runoff, a
  program developed on the MIT CTSS System.  ...  Both nroff and troff were
  developed in the mid-seventies by Joseph Osanna, who was killed in an
  accident in 1977.  Since then, the programs have served Bell Labs and a
  large number of academic institutions well, and in the past few years have
  spread to private business.

  nroff produces typewritten documents; troff is the typesetting program.
  It is an important advantage to them that they share common commands, like
  those that determine the length of a line of formatted text or the length
  of a page.  It is possible, then, to create a typewritten version of a file
  and then produce a typeset version without any changes.  Those commands that
  are appropriate for printing (for example, size of type, spacing between
  lines) are ignored by nroff.  The two programs were originally created to
  generate internal memoranda and patent applications, and the pragmatic
  demands of this work may have determined their essential characteristics as
  formatters, characteristics that can be described as a blend of inconven-
  ience and efficiency.
