Description:	t_utils - GNU text utilities

Version:	1.1

Notes:

  These are the GNU text file processing utilities.  Most of these programs
  have significant advantages over their Unix counterparts, such as greater
  speed, additional options, and fewer arbitrary limits.  Some of these
  programs used to be in the GNU file utilities.

  ...

  The textutils are intended to be POSIX compliant (with BSD and other
  extensions), like the rest of the GNU system.  They are not all quite
  there yet; however, the POSIX shell and utilities standard (1003.2)
  has not been finalized, either.  They presently don't support
  internationalization features.
