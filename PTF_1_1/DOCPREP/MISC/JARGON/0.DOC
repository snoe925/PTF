Description:	jargon - GNU/MIT Jargon file, etc.

Version:	original, 296

Notes:

  We make several versions of the Jargon File available here.

  jargon.text.Z is the original MIT/Stanford AI jargon file.

  jargon296.ascii.Z is the sixfold-expanded version published in 1991 as
        "The New Hacker's Dictionary" by MIT Press.  This is the entire
        text, except for Guy Steele's and Eric Raymond's introductions
        and the "vietnam wall" credits list at the end (and of course
        no fancy fonts and cartoons).

  Comming soon (January 1992):

  jargon298.ascii: 1992 update, with corrections and new entries.

  jargon298.info: the File as a browseable Info document.

  vh.tar.Z: the volks-hypertext browser for the Jargon File.
