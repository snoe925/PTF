Description:	ispell - GNU spelling checker

Version:	2.0.02

Notes:

  Ispell is fashioned after the spell program from ITS (called ispell on
  Twenex systems.)  The most common usage is "ispell filename".  In this
  case, ispell will display each word which does not appear in the
  dictionary, and allow you to change it.  If there are "near misses" in
  the dictionary (words which differ by only a single letter, a missing
  or extra letter, or a pair of transposed letters), then they are also
  displayed.  If you think the word is correct as it stands, you can type
  either "Space" to accept it this one time, or "I" to accept it and put
  it in your private dictionary.  If one of the near misses is the word
  you want, type the corresponding number.  (If there are more than 10
  choices, you may have to type a carriage return to complete a single-
  digit number).  Finally, if none of these choices is right, you can
  type "R" and you will be prompted for a replacement word.  If you want
  to see a list of words that might be close using wildcard characters,
  type "L" to lookup a word in the system dictionary.

  When a misspelled word is found, it is printed at the top of the screen.
  Any near misses will be printed on the following lines, and finally, two
  lines containing the word are printed at the bottom of the screen.  If
  your terminal can type in reverse video, the word itself is highlighted.
