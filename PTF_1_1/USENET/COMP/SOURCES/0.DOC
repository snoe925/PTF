Description:	"comp.sources" Usenet Archives

Notes:

  The "comp.sources" archives contain computer source code.  Let's say Joe
  Programmer has a nifty hack that he wants folks to use.  He mails it to
  the moderator of "comp.sources.xxx".  The moderator logs it in, evaluates
  it, and (perhaps) posts it to the group.  At that point, the code is one
  with the ages.  A zillion archive sites stash it away; miscellaneous
  hackers try it out, etc.  Anyway, here are some of those archived groups.
