Description:	Usenet Archives

Notes:

  The Usenet is a collection of machines that form a world-wide distributed
  bulletin board.  The topics are diverse -- over 1000 "newsgroups" are now
  in existence.  The volume is also high -- a site that takes "everything"
  could well receive over 30 MB per day.

  Nobody can read that much traffic, but then nobody does.  People find the
  groups which interest them, "kill" off boring sub-topics, and skim for the
  nuggets.  Some users have created "agents", which search for interesting
  postings.  Anything by dmr, for instance.

  Some groups, because of the efforts of a moderator, have relatively high
  amounts of content.  The trade-off is immediacy -- the moderator may not
  get to the group every hour, or even every day.  For source code groups,
  however, this works just fine.

  This sub-tree is very sparse at present -- you will probably want to skip
  straight to usenet/comp/sources.  We expect to expand it in upcoming discs,
  however, so we decided to keep the name space in line with that used by
  the Usenet.  We apologize for any inconvenience.
