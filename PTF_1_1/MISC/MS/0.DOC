Package:	misc/ms

Description:	MandelSpawn - network Mandelbrot

Version:	0.04

Notes:

  Ms is a program for interactive display of the Mandelbrot and Julia sets
  under the X window system.  You can select an area of interest using the
  mouse and zoom in on it either in the same window or by popping up a new
  window.

  Ms relies on "computation server" processes (see mslaved (1)) running on
  one or more machines to do the actual computations.
