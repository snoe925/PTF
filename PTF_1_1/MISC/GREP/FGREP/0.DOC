Package:	misc/grep/fgrep

Description:	GNU fgrep

Version:	1.1

Notes:

  This is GNU fgrep, version 1.1.  Eventually it will disappear into the
  single grep program mandated by POSIX, but for now it should be a
  compatible replacement for UNIX fgrep.  The options are the same as
  those of GNU egrep, and are a proper superset of the fgrep options
  on all UNIX systems I am aware of.
 
  I have not tried comparing this performance-wise to any of the
  various other free fgreps that are floating around, but it should
  never be any slower, and for demanding applications will probably
  be substantially faster.  For single fixed-string searches the
  speed is about the same as that of GNU egrep; for multiple fixed
  strings it is substantially faster.
