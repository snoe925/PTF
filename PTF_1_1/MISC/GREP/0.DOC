Topic:		misc/grep

Description:	grep, fgrep, etc.

Notes:

  Grep, a cognate for grasp, grope, and grab, actually traces its name
  to the "Global Regular Expression Print" (:g/.../p) operation available
  in editors such as ed, ex, and vi.  In any case, it is a very handy tool,
  and the best freeware versions are markedly superior to the commercial
  ones.

Contains:

  fgrep     P    GNU fgrep
  grep      P    GNU grep
