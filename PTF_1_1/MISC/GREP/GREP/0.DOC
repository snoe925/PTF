Package:	misc/grep/grep

Description:	GNU grep

Version:	1.5

Notes:

  Grep searches the files listed in the arguments (or standard input if no
  files are given) for all lines that contain a match for the given expr.  If
  any lines match, they are printed.

  Also, if any matches were found, grep will exit with a status of 0, but if
  no matches were found it will exit with a status of 1.  This is useful for
  building shell scripts that use grep as a condition for, for example, the
  if statement.

	.../grep.man

  GNU e?grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
  twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
  search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
  considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
  look at every character.  The result is typically many times faster
  than Unix grep or egrep.  (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
  may run more slowly, however.)
