Package:	misc/f_utils

Description:	fileutils - GNU file utilities

Version:	3.1

Notes:

  These are the GNU file management utilities.  Most of these programs
  have significant advantages over their Unix counterparts, such as
  greater speed, additional options, and fewer arbitrary limits.

  ...

  The fileutils are intended to be POSIX compliant (with BSD and other
  extensions), like the rest of the GNU system.  They are not all quite
  there yet; however, the POSIX shell and utilities standard (1003.2)
  has not been finalized, either.  They presently don't support
  internationalization features.
