Package:	misc/find

Description:	find - GNU find, etc.

Version:	3.2

Notes:

  This package contains the GNU find, xargs, and locate programs.  find
  and xargs comply with POSIX 1003.2 draft 11.1, as far as I know.  They
  also support some additional options, some borrowed from Unix and some
  unique to GNU.

  ...

  The locate utility is based on James Woods' public domain fast-find
  code, which is also distributed with the 4.3BSD find.  Because POSIX
  requires `find foo' to have the same effect as `find foo -print', the
  fast-find searching has been moved to a separate program, `locate';
  the same thing has been done in 4.3BSD-reno/4.4BSD.  If you use
  locate, you should run the included `updatedb' script from cron
  periodically (typically nightly).
