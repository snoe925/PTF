Package:	misc/less

Description:	less - GNU more (more or less)

Version:	177

Notes:

  Less is a program similar to more (1), but which allows backward movement
  in the file as well as forward movement.  Also, less does not have to read
  the entire input file before starting, so with large input files it starts
  up faster than text editors like vi (1).  Less uses termcap (or terminfo
  on some systems), so it can run on a variety of terminals.  There is even
  limited support for hardcopy terminals.  (On a hardcopy terminal, lines
  which should be printed at the top of the screen are prefixed with an up-
  arrow.)
