Description:	The Prolog Programming Language

Notes:

  The computer programming language Prolog is quickly gaining popularity
  throughout the world.  Since its beginnings around 1970, Prolog has
  been chosen by many programmers for applications of symbolic computation,
  including:

	relational databases
	mathematical logic
	abstract problem solving
	understanding natural language
	architectural design
	symbolic equation solving
	biochemical structure analysis
	many areas of artificial intelligence

  ...

  Many newcomers to Prolog find that the task of writing a Prolog program
  is not like specifying an algorithm in the same way as in a conventional
  programming language.  Instead, the Prolog programmer asks more what
  formal relationships and objects occur in his problem, and what rela-
  tionships are "true" about the desired solution.  So, Prolog can be
  viewed as a descriptive language as well as a prescriptive one.  The
  Prolog approach is rather to describe known facts and relationships about
  a problem, than to prescribe the sequence of steps taken by a computer
  to solve the problem.  When a computer is programmed in Prolog, the actual
  way the computer carries out the computation is specified partly by the
  logical declarative semantics of Prolog, partly by what new facts Prolog
  can 'infer' from the given ones, and only partly by explicit control
  information supplied by the programmer.

  Prolog is a practical and efficient implementation of many aspects of
  'intelligent' program execution, such as non-determinism, parallelism,
  and pattern-directed procedure call.  Prolog provides a uniform data
  structure, called the term, out of which all data, as well as Prolog
  programs, are constructed.  A Prolog program consists of a set of
  clauses, where each clause is either a fact about the given information
  or a rule about how the solution may relate to or be 'inferred' from
  the given facts.  Thus, Prolog can be seen as a first step towards the
  ultimate goal of programming in logic.
