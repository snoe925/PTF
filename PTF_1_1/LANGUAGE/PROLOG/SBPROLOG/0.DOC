Description:	The SB-Prolog system

Version:	3.1

Notes:

  SB-Prolog is a Prolog system for Unix based systems.  The core of the
  system is an emulator, written in C for portability, of a Prolog virtual
  machine that is an extension of the Warren Abstract Machine.  The
  remainder of the system, including the translator from Prolog to the
  virtual machine instructions, is written in Prolog.

  Parts of this manual, specifically the sections on Prolog syntax and
  descriptions of some of the builtins, are based on the C-Prolog User
  Manual by Fernando Pereira.
