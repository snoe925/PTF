Description:	SR Programming Language

Version:	1.1

Notes:

  This document surveys the changes introduced between Version 1.0 and
  Version 1.1 of the SR Programming Language.  The revised language is
  described more precisely in the reference manual.

  New Platforms

  SR now supports a wider variety of system architectures.  New systems 
  include the Decstation 3100, the Sun 4, the NeXT computer system, and the
  Hewlett-Packard 9000 (series 300 and 800).  SR can now also run on Vax
  Ultrix systems if the GNU C compiler is available.  As a result of the
  modifications these systems required, additional ports should be
  considerably easier.
