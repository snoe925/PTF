Description:	Assemblers

Notes:

  Assemblers translate assembly language into binary machine codes.  Each
  computer architecture uses different codes, so the assembly language for
  each machine is unique.  Nonetheless, the translation process is very
  similar for all such languages, and a single assembler can thus be made
  to serve a variety of machines.
