Description:    T - dialect of Lisp

Version:        3.1

Notes:
 
  T is a dialect of Lisp derived from SCHEME.  It is comparable in power and
  expressiveness to other recent Lisp dialects such as Lisp Machine Lisp,
  Common Lisp, and NIL, but fundamentally more similar in spirit to SCHEME
  than these other Lisp dialects.

  T endeavors to be a powerful, expressive language which also permits
  portable and efficient implementations.  T is a "modern" Lisp suitable
  for a broad variety of applications, including symbolic, numerical, and
  systems programming, on a variety of machines.

  T draws from many sources in its attempt to provide a complete yet simple
  and unified system.  For the most part, the language's designers are
  collators, not originators.  Common Lisp, NIL, and SCHEME have been the
  strongest influences.
