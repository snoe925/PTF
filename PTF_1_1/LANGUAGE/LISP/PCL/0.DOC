Description:    PCL - Portable CommonLoops

Version:        ?

Notes:
 
  Portable CommonLoops (PCL) started out as an implementation of CommonLoops
  written entirely in CommonLisp.  It is in the process of being converted to
  an implementation of CLOS.  Currently it implements a only a subset of the
  CLOS specification.  Unfortunately, there is no detailed description of the
  differences between PCL and the CLOS specification, the source code is
  often the best documentation.
