Package:        language/lisp/scheme/oaklisp

Description:    The CMU implementation of Oaklisp

Version:        release-30-sep-90

Notes:
 
  Oaklisp is an object-oriented dialect of Scheme.  This implementation is
  highly portable, compiling to a virtual machine which is emulated by a
  C program.  Nevertheless, reasonable speed is achieved through a variety
  of sophisticated techniques.
