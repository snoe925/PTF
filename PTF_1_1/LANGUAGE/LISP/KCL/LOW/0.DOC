Package:        language/lisp/kcl/low

Description:    low for Kyoto Common Lisp (KCL)

Version:        ?

Notes:
 
  The reason these are here is because the KCL compiler does not allow
  LET to return FIXNUM values as values of (c) type int, hence the use
  of LOCALLY (which expands into (LET () (DECLARE ...) ...)) forces
  conversion of ints to objects.
