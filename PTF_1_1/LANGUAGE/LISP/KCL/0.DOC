Description:	KCL - Kyoto Common Lisp

Notes:

  The distribution policy for Kyoto Common Lisp has had a strong effect on
  the package's use and development.  KCL users are required to send in a
  license form, and are not allowed to distribute modified version of the
  package.  Consequently, all modifications to KCL take the form of deltas
  against the original KCL distribution.

  More particularly, it has had an effect on us.  As we read their notice,
  we are prohibited from including the package on our disc, because we have
  no way of ensuring that all of our purchasers have sent in the form.  So
  we find ourselves in the peculiar position of supplying a large number of
  patches to a freeware package that we cannot supply.  With luck, this may
  be resolved at some future point.  Until then, you'll have to rely on
  FTP, etc., to get the KCL distribution...
