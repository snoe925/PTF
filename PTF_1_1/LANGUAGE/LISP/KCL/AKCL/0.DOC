Package:        language/lisp/kcl/akcl

Description:    AKCL - Austin Kyoto Common Lisp

Version:        1-605

Notes:
 
  The AKCL system contains change files (usually V/* files) together
  with a method for combining these with the original KCL distribution.
  The latter is the June 1987 version.  The utility merge, takes files
  from the original distribution and modifies them according to a
  prescription in a `change file'.  The change files reside in the
  directory V.  The enhancements include enhancements to the lisp
  compiler, loader, and to the basic C code.  If installed properly
  NOTHING in the original kcl directory should be overwritten.  Files
  which have not changed will have only a link copy in the akcl directory,
  and files which do change will have a changed copy in the akcl
  directory, and an unchanged file in the kcl directory.  To ensure that
  you do not accidentally alter a file in the original directory you
  might wish to make the files there unwritable.  You do not need
  to do a make in the kcl directory.
