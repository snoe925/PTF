Description:	Lisp Language Tools

Notes:

  The Lisp programming language, possibly because of its very limited
  notions of syntex, has proven to be a remarkably flexible and extensible
  tool.  With the advent of standardization, many of the extensions are
  becoming documented and widely usable.
