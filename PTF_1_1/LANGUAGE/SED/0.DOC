Description:	The Sed Programming Language

Notes:

  Sed is a "stream editor", capable of doing many of the kinds of editing
  tasks normally done by ex/vi or emacs, but on a stream of data.  This is
  very useful when the file to be edited is very large, or if it never really
  exists (as in a pipeline).  Unfortunately, sed has the syntax and structure
  of a simplistic assembly language, making sed programs an exercise in
  inscrutability.
