Package:	language/sed/gnu_sed

Description:	GNU sed

Version:	1.08

Notes:

  This sed may run slower than some UN*X seds.  This is because it uses
  the regular-expression routines from Emacs, which are rather complete
  and powerful, but not as fast as they could be.  If you really care
  about speed, use perl instead.
