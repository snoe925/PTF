Description:	Computer Languages

Notes:

  Computer language processing tools come in a variety of flavors: compilers,
  interpreters, debuggers, linkers, etc.  Most of these tools are specific to
  a particular language (e.g., C).  For portability, an increasing number of
  languages are being translated to, or implemented in, the C language.  This
  allows them to run, at some cost in execution speed, on almost any current
  machine.
