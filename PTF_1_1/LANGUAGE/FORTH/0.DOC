Description:	Forth Language Tools

Notes:

  FORTH is a very portable language, based on Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).
  It is commonly implemented by means of an "incremental compiler", which
  interactively accepts code, processes it into internal form, and stores it.

  FORTH code tends to be very compact, and it commonly has very tight access
  to the hardware of the computer.  (On UNIX systems, the kernel disallows
  this, but code ported to microprocessors will regain this access.)

  There is an active FORTH user community, quite disjunct from the usual
  UNIX and AI crowd.  For information, contact:
