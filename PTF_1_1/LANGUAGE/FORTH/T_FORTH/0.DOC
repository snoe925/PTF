Description:	TILE Forth

Version:	2.1

Notes:

  TILE Forth is a 32-bit implementation of the Forth-83 Standard 
  written in C. Thus allowing it to be easily moved between different 
  computers compared to traditional Forth implementations in assembly.

  Most Forth implementations are done in assembly to be able to
  utilize the underlying architecture as optimal as possible. TILE 
  Forth goes another direction. The main idea behind TILE Forth is to 
  achieve a portable forth implementation for workstations and medium 
  size computer systems so that new groups of programmers may be exposed 
  to the flavor of an extensible language such as Forth. 

  The implementation of TILE Forth is selected so that, in principle, 
  any C-level procedure may become available on the interactive and
  incremental forth level. Other models of implementation of a threaded
  interpreter in C are possible but these are not as flexible.
