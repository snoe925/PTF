Description:	The AWK Programming Language

Notes:

  Computer users spend a lot of time doing simple, mechanical data manipula-
  tion -- changing the format of data, checking its validity, finding items
  with some property, adding up numbers, printing reports, and the like.  All
  of these jobs ought to be mechanized, but it's a real nuisance to have to
  write a special-purpose program in a standardized language like C or Pascal
  each time such a task comes up.

  Awk is a programming language that makes it possible to handle such tasks
  with very short programs, often only one or two lines long.  An awk program
  is a sequence of patterns and actionsthat tell what to look for in the input
  data and what to do when it's found.  Awk searches a set of files for lines
  matched by any of the patterns; when a matching line is found, the corres-
  ponding action is performed.  A pattern can select lines by combinations of
  regular expressions and comparison operations on strings, numbers, fields,
  variables, and array elements.  Actions may perform arbitrary processing on
  selected lines; the action language looks like C but there are no declara-
  tions, and strings and numbers are built-in data types.

  Awk scans the input files and splits each input line into fields automatic-
  ally.  Because so many things are automatic -- input, field splitting,
  storage management, initialization -- awk programs are usually much smaller
  than they would be in a more conventional language.  Thus one common use of
  awk is for the kind of data manipulation suggested above.  Programs, a line
  or two long, are composed at the keyboard, run once, then discarded.  In
  effect, awk is a general-purpose programmable tool that can replace a host
  of specialized tools or programs.
