Description:	bash - GNU Bourne Again SHell

Version:	1.10

Notes:

  Bash is the GNU Project's Bourne Again SHell, an interactive shell with
  Bourne shell syntax (/bin/sh); but also with interactive command line
  editing, job control on architectures that support it, Csh-like history
  features and brace expansion, and a slew of other stuff.

	.../README

  Bash is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes
  commands read from the standard input or from a file.  Bash also
  incorporates useful features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh).

  Bash is ultimately intended to be a faithful implementation of the IEEE
  Posix Shell and Tools specification (IEEE Working Group 1003.2).
