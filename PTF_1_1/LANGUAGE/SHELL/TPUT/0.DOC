Package:	language/shell/tput

Description:	tput - Portable Terminal Control Utility

Version:	1.0

Notes:

  The tput command translates the terminal-independent name of a terminal
  capability into its actual value for the terminal type being used.  This
  allows shell scripts to do things like clear the screen, underline text,
  and center text no matter how wide the screen is.

  tput takes as an argument the name of a Unix System V terminfo capability,
  which it translates into the equivalent termcap capability name.

  There are three types of terminfo (and termcap) capabilities: string,
  Boolean, and numeric.  String capabilities either cause a special effect
  on the terminal when they are displayed or are the value sent by a special
  key on the terminal (the latter type are probably of no use in shell
  scripts).  Numeric and Boolean capabilities give information about the
  terminal such as how many columns wide it is or whether whether it has a
  meta key.
