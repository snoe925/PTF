Package:	language/bc/gnu_bc

Description:	gnu_bc - GNU bc

Version:	1.01

Notes:

  bc is an arbitrary precision numeric processing language.  Syntax is
  similar to C, but differs in many substantial areas.  It supports
  interactive execution of statements.  bc is a utility included in the
  POSIX P1003.2/D11 draft standard.  

  This version was written to be a POSIX compliant bc processor with
  several extensions to the draft standard.  Option flags are available
  to cause warning or rejection of the extensions to the POSIX standard.
  For those who want only POSIX bc with no extensions, a grammar is
  provided for exactly the language described in the POSIX document.
  The grammar (sbc.y) comes from the POSIX document.  The Makefile
  contains rules to make sbc.  (for Standard BC)
 
  Since the POSIX document does not specify how bc must be implemented,
  this version does not use the historical method of having bc be a
  compiler for the dc calculator.  This version has a single executable
  that both compiles the language and runs the a resulting "byte code".
  The "byte code" is NOT the dc language.
  
  Also, included in the initial distribution is the library file
  vfprintf.c for MINIX systems.  My minix 1.5 did not have this file.
  Also, you should verify that vsprintf.c works correctly on your
  system.

  The extensions add some features I think are missing.  The major
  changes and additions for bc are

    (a) names are allowed to be full identifiers ([a-z][a-z0-9_]*),
    (b) addition of the &&, ||, and ! operators,
    (c) allowing comparison and boolean operations in any expression,
    (d) addition of an else clause to the if statement,
    (e) addition of a new standard function "read()" that reads a
        number from the standard input under program control,
    (f) passing of arrays as parameters by variable,
    (g) addition of the "halt" statement that is an executable
        statement unlike the quit (i.e.  "if (1 == 0) quit" will
        halt bc but "if (1 == 0) halt" will not halt bc.), and
    (h) the addition of the special variable "last" that is assigned
        the value of each print as the number is printed.
