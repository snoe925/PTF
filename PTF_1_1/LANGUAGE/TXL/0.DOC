Description:	TXL - Tree Transformation Language

Notes:

  TXL is a generalized source-to-source translation system suitable for 
  prototyping computer languages of any kind.  It has been used to 
  prototype several new programming languages as well as specification 
  and command languages.  TXL takes as input an arbitrary context-free 
  grammar in BNF-like notation, and a set of show-by-example transformation 
  rules to be applied to inputs parsed using the grammar.  TXL will 
  automatically parse inputs in the language described by the grammar, 
  no matter how ambiguous or left-recursive, and then successively apply 
  the transformation rules to the parsed input until they fail, producing 
  as output the transformed source.
