Description:	The C++ Programming Language

Notes:

  C++ is a general purpose programming language designed to make programming
  more enjoyable for the serious programmer.  Except for minor details, C++
  is a superset of the C programming language.  In addition to the facilities
  provided by C, C++ provides flexible and efficient facilities for defining
  new types.  A programmer can partition an application into manageable pieces
  by defining new types that closely match the concepts of the application.
  This technique for program construction is called data abstraction.  Objects
  of some user-defined types contain type information.  Such objects can be
  used safely and conveniently in contexts in which their type cannot be
  determined at compile time.  Programs using objects of such types are often
  called object based.  When used well, these techniques result in shorter,
  easier to understand, and easier to maintain programs.
