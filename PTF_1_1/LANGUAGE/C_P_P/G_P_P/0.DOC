Description:	g++ - GNU C++

Version:	1.39.1, 1.40.3

Notes:

  GNU C++ is GNU CC, with a C++ front end.  GNU CC is the Free Software
  Foundation's optimizing, retargetable, ANSI C compiler.  GNU CC has
  source level debugging support from the GDB debugger (also available
  from the Free Software Foundation).  For more information about GNU
  CC, write to the Free Software Foundation at the address given below.
  GNU C++ is an extension of GNU CC.  It keeps the powerful optimizer,
  and maintains a high degree of source-level debugging support, while
  providing the object-oriented features of C++.  Numerous files have
  been added, changed, and hacked without mercy from their original GNU
  CC incarnation to make this compiler accept a reasonable super/subset
  of C++.

  *Disclaimer*: GNU C++ is not perfectly compatible with AT&T
  C++.  It is, however, a reasonably faithful implementation of C++ as
  described in the C++ reference manual.  To make GNU C++ more mobile,
  only the files that are not shared with GNU CC are currently being
  distributed.  If you do not have GNU CC yet, or your version is older
  than 1.39, you should take care of getting that first.  GNU CC is
  available to sites which have anonymous ftp capability to
  prep.ai.mit.edu.  Contact the Free Software Foundation for more
  information.
