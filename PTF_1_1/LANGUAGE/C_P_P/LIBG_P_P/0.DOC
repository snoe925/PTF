Description:	libg++ - GNU C++ library

Version:	1.39.0

Notes:

  The GNU C++ library, libg++ is an attempt to provide a variety of C++
  programming tools and other support to GNU C++ programmers.

  Differences in distribution policy are only part of the difference
  between libg++.a and AT&T libC.a.  libg++ is not intended to be an
  exact clone of libC. For one, libg++ contains bits of code that depend
  on special features of GNU g++ that are either different or lacking in
  the AT&T version, including slightly different inlining and overloading
  strategies, dynamic local arrays, wrappers, etc.  All of these
  differences are minor. For example, while the AT&T and GNU stream
  classes are implemented in very different ways, the vast majority of
  C++ programs compile and run under either version with no visible
  difference. Additionally, all g++-specific constructs are conditionally
  compiled; The library is designed to be compatible with any 2.0 C++
  compiler.

  libg++ has also contained workarounds for some limitations in g++:
  both g++ and libg++ are still undergoing rapid development and testing
  -- a task that is helped tremendously by the feedback of active users.
