Description:	The Tk Toolkit for X11

Version:	1.0

Notes:

  This paper describes a new toolkit for X11 called Tk.  The overall functions
  provided by Tk are similar to those of the standard toolkit Xt.  However,
  Tk is implemented using Tcl, a lightweight interpretive command language.
  This means that Tk's functions are available not just from C code compiled
  into the application but also via Tcl commands issued dynamically while the
  application runs.  Tcl commands are used for binding keystrokes and other
  events to application-specified actions, for creating and configuring
  widgets, and for dealing with geometry managers and the selection.  The use
  of an interpretive language means that any aspect of the user interface may
  be changed dynamically while an application executes.  It also means that
  many interesting applications can be created without writing any new C code,
  simply by writing Tcl scripts for existing applications.  Furthermore,  Tk
  provides a special "send" command that allows any Tk-based application to
  invoke Tcl commands in any other Tk-based application.  Send allows
  applications to communicate in more powerful ways than a selection
  mechanism and makes it possible to replace monolithic applications with
  collections of reusable tools.
