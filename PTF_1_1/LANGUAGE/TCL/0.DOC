Description:	Tcl - an embeddable command language

Notes:

  John Ouster wrote Tcl, and more recently Tk.  Don Libes came along with
  expect, and we fully "expect" to see more good code coming out of this
  area of inquiry.

Contains:

  expect    P    expect - Interactive Program Harness
  tcl       P    Tcl - Tool Command Language
  tk        P    The Tk Toolkit for X11
