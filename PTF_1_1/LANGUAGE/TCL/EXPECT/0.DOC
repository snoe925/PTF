Description:	expect - Interactive Program Harness

Version:	2.56

Notes:

  expect is a program that "talks" to other interactive programs according
  to a script.  Following the script, expect knows what can be expected from
  a program and what the correct response should be.  An interpreted language
  provides branching and high-level control structures to direct the dialogue.
  (Alternatively, the user may use the C language directly. See libexpect(3).)
  In addition, the user can take control and interact directly when desired,
  afterward returning control to the script.
