Description:	Practical Extraction and Report Language

Version:	4.019

Notes:

  Perl is an interpreted language optimized for scanning arbitrary text files,
  extracting information from those text files, and printing reports based on
  that information.  It's also a good language for many system management
  tasks.  The language is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient,
  complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal).
  It combines (in the author's opinion, anyway) some of the best features of
  C, \fIsed\fR, \fIawk\fR, and \fIsh\fR, so people familiar with those
  languages should have little difficulty with it.  (Language historians will
  also note some vestiges of \fIcsh\fR, Pascal, and even BASIC-PLUS.)
  Expression syntax corresponds quite closely to C expression syntax.  Unlike
  most Unix utilities, perl does not arbitrarily limit the size of your data
  -- if you've got the memory, perl can slurp in your whole file as a single
  string.  Recursion is of unlimited depth.  And the hash tables used by
  associative arrays grow as necessary to prevent degraded performance.  Perl
  uses sophisticated pattern matching techniques to scan large amounts of data
  very quickly.  Although optimized for scanning text, perl can also deal with
  binary data, and can make dbm files look like associative arrays (where dbm
  is available).  Setuid perl scripts are safer than C programs through a
  dataflow tracing mechanism which prevents many stupid security holes.  If
  you have a problem that would ordinarily use sed or awk or sh, but it
  exceeds their capabilities or must run a little faster, and you don't want
  to write the silly thing in C, then perl may be for you.  There are also
  translators to turn your sed and awk scripts into perl scripts.  OK, enough
  hype.
