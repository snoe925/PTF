Description:	bison - GNU yacc

Version:	1.14

Notes:

  Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts a grammar
  description for an LALR(1) context-free grammar into a C program to parse
  that grammar.  Once you are proficient with Bison, you may use it to
  develop a wide range of language parsers, from those used in simple desk
  calculators to complex programming languages.

  Bison is upward compatible with Yacc: all properly-written Yacc grammars
  ought to work with Bison with no change.  Anyone familiar with Yacc
  should be able to use Bison with little trouble.  You need to be fluent in
  C programming in order to use Bison or to understand this manual.

  We begin with tutorial chapters that explain the basic concepts of using
  Bison and show three explained examples, each building on the last.  If you
  don't know Bison or Yacc, start by reading these chapters.  Reference
  chapters follow which describe specific aspects of Bison in detail.

  Bison was written primarily by Robert Corbett; Richard Stallman made
  it Yacc-compatible.  This edition corresponds to version 1.10 of Bison.
