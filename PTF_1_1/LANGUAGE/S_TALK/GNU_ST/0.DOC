Package:	language/s_talk/gnu_st

Description:	GNU SmallTalk

Version:	1.1.1

Notes:

  GNU Smalltalk attempts to be a reasonably faithful implementation of
  Smalltalk-80 as described in the "Blue Book", also known as "Smalltalk-80,
  the Language and its Implementation", by Adele Goldberg and David Robson.
  The syntax that the language accepts and the byte codes that the virtual
  machine interprets are exactly as they appear in the Blue Book.  Most of
  the primitives are the same as well, although due to the differing nature
  of the implementation some of the primitives haven't been implemented, and
  other new ones have been.

  The current implementation has the following features:

    * Incremental garbage collector
    * Binary image save capability
    * C-callout (allows Smalltalk to invoke user-written C code and pass
      parameters to it)
    * GNU Emacs editing mode
    * Highly portable C code implementation
    * Optional byte code compilation tracing and byte code execution tracing
    * Automatically loaded per-user initialization files
