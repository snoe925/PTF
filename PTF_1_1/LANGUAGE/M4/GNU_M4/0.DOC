Package:	language/m4/gnu_m4

Description:	GNU m4 clone

Version:	1.0

Notes:

  m4 is a macro processor, in the sense that in copies its input to the
  output, expanding macros as it goes.  Macros are either builtin or
  user-defined, and can take any number of arguments.  Besides just doing
  macro expansion, m4 has builtin functions for including named files,
  running Unix commands, doing integer arithmetic, manipulating text in
  various ways, recursion, etc...

  m4 can be used either as a front-end to a compiler, or as a macro
  processor in its own right.

  GNU m4 is mostly compatible with the System V, release 3 version,
  except for some minor differences.
