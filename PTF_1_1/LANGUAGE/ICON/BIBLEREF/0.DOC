Package:	language/icon/bibleref

Description:	Bibleref - Icon-based Bible browser

Version:	2.1

Notes:

  This package, Bibleref, offers simple tools for word and passage-based
  access to the King James or Revised Standard Version of the Bible on UNIX
  platforms.  Bibleref is quick, and fairly easy to install (assuming you
  possess a suitable King James Bible text, a sufficiently powerful machine,
  and know a little about Icon).  It will also run with stock terminals -
  even nasty old ones that leave magic cookies on your screen.  Bibleref
  will, however, put a significant dent in your mass storage resources.
  Your 4-5 megabyte King James or RSV text will get block Huffman encoded,
  which will bring it down to about three.  The freed space, however, will
  be gobbled up immediately by some 2 megabytes of auxiliary files, and by
  the 150k executable (more if you compile, rather than interpret).  In-core
  requirements for the executable start at about 300k, and go up from there
  (if your searches are complex enough, you could easily eat up two or three
  megabytes).  In brief: Bibleref has a large appetite for memory.  Once set
  up, though, it can operate with fairly minimal impact on the CPU.

  With Bibleref, you can perform most of the more basic, low-level functions
  commercial Bible browsing packages offer (and perhaps a few not found in
  some of the commercial packages).  You can, for example,

    -  retrieve any passage in the Bible instantaneously
    -  move forward or backward relative to the retrieved passage
    -  search the entire Bible for words and/or word-patterns
    -  search for word co-occurrences (or the absence thereof)
    -  save passages and/or passage-lists for use with an editor

  Although this program is hardly the product of any major research effort
  :-), it should prove sophisticated enough for quick lookup of passages
  whose precise location you have forgotten, for research on sermons and
  Bible study classes, and for general topical perusal of the biblical text.
