Description:	The Icon Programming Language

Notes:

  Icon is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that offers a
  broad range of string- and list-processing facilities.  It also has a
  novel expression evaluation mechanism and allows an unusual degree of
  run-time flexibility.

	- Preface, The Implementation of the Icon Programming Language

  Icon also excels at data structures.  It has lists (subscript or push/pop
  at either end), sets, and tables (associative arrays).  Any of these can
  have any of the others as members, allowing quite nifty combinations.
