Description:	gmp - GNU multiple precision (MP) library

Version:	1.1

Notes:

  GNU MP is a library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on
  signed integers and rational numbers.  It has a rich set of functions,
  and the functions have a regular interface.

  I have tried to make these functions as fast as possible, both for small
  operands and for huge operands.  The speed is achieved by using fullwords
  as the basic arithmetic type, by using fast algorithms, by defining inline
  assembler for mixed sized multiplication and division (i.e 32*32->64 bit
  multiplication and 64/32->32,32 bit division), and by hacking the code
  with emphasis on speed (and not simplicity and elegance).

  The speed of GNU MP is about 5 to 100 times that of Berkeley MP for
  small operands.  The speed-up increases with the operand sizes for
  certain operations, where GNU MP has asymptotically faster algorithms
