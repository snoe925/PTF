Package:	language/c/library/readline

Description:	GNU history and readline libraries

Version:	1.1

Notes:

  Many programs read input from the user a line at a time.  The GNU history
  library is able to keep track of those lines, associate arbitrary data with
  each line, and utilize information from previous lines in making up new
  ones.

  The programmer using the History library has available to him functions
  for remembering lines on a history stack, associating arbitrary data
  with a line, removing lines from the stack, searching through the stack
  for a line containing an arbitrary text string, and referencing any line
  on the stack directly.  In addition, a history @dfn{expansion} function
  is available which provides for a consistent user interface across many
  different programs.

  The end-user using programs written with the History library has the
  benifit of a consistent user interface, with a set of well-known
  commands for manipulating the text of previous lines and using that text
  in new commands.  The basic history manipulation commands are similar to
  the history substitution used by @code{Csh}.

  If the programmer desires, he can use the Readline library, which
  includes some history manipulation by default, and has the added
  advantage of Emacs style command line editing.
