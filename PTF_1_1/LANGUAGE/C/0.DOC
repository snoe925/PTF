Description:	C Language Tools

Notes:

  C is a general-purpose programming languyage which features economy of
  expression, modern control flow and data structures, and a rich set of
  operators.  C is not a "very high level" language, nor a "big" one, and
  is not specialized to any particular area of application.  But its
  absence of restrictions and its generality make it more convenient and
  effective for many tasks than supposedly more powerful languages.
