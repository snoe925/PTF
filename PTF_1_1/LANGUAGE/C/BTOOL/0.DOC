Description:	btool - measure C branch coverage

Version:	1.3

Notes:

  This tool is used to measure whether a test suite forces every branch
  in a program to be taken in every possible way.  If it hasn't, you may
  need to write more tests.  The tool is intended to be used in the
  testing of large systems written in C, including the UNIX kernel and
  embedded systems.  Such systems have certain characteristics that
  affected the design:

  1. The process of compiling the system is a complex task in its own
  right.  The tool should require only minor and isolated changes to
  this process.  (If you use makefiles, usually only one needs to be
  changed.)

  2. Such systems often must be cross-compiled on a host and then
  downloaded to the target machine, or they depend on a particular C
  compiler in some other way.  Therefore, adding branch coverage
  instrumentation must be a source-to-source transformation.

  3. Embedded systems will not be able to use ordinary file I/O.  The
  internal interface is designed and documented so that the tester can
  easily write the code used to extract branch coverage information.
  (When testing application programs, you just use the code provided
  with the tool.)
