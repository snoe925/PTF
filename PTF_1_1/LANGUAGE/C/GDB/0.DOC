Description:	gdb - GNU debugger

Version:	3.5, 4.0.1, 4.1, 4.3

Notes:

  The purpose of a debugger such as GDB is to allow you to see what is going
  on "inside" another program while it executes--or what another program was
  doing at the moment it crashed.

  GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of
  these) to help you catch bugs in the act:

   * Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its
     behavior.

   * Make your program stop on specified conditions.

   * Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.

   * Change things in your program, so you can experiment with
     correcting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about
     another.

  You can use GDB to debug programs written in C, C++, and Modula-2.
  Fortran support will be added when a GNU Fortran compiler is ready.
