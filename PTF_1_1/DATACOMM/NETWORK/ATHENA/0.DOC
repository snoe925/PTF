Description:	Project Athena

Notes:

  Project Athena at MIT has emerged as one of the most important models of
  next generation distributed computing in the academic environment.  MIT
  pioneered this new systems approach to computation based on the client-
  server model to support a network of workstations.  This new model is
  replacing time-sharing (which MIT also pioneered) as the preferred model
  of computing at the Institute.  Athena is unique in that it is one of the
  first and one of the largest integrated implementations of this new model,
  perhaps paralleled only by the Andrew project at Carnegie-Mellon
  University.  Athena's uniqueness has led to widespread interest in its
  design, implementation, and results.
