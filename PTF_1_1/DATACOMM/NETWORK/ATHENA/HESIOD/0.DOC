Package:	datacomm/network/athena/hesiod

Description:	hesiod - the Project Athena nameserver

Version:	1.2

Notes:

  Hesiod, the Athena name server, provides naming for services and data
  objects in a distributed network environment.  More specifically, it
  replaces databases that heretofore have had to be duplicated on each
  workstation and timesharing machine (e.g., remote file system information,
  /etc/printcap, /etc/services, /etc/passwd, /etc/group) and provides a
  flexible mechanism to supply new information as the need arises.
