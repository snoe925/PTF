Description:	zephyr - Project Athena Service Mgt. System

Version:	3.19 (patchlevel 3)

Notes:

  Zephyr is a notice transport and delivery system under development at
  Project Athena.  Zephyr is for use by network-based services and
  applications with a need for immediate, reliable, and rapid
  communication with their clients.  Zephyr meets the high-throughput,
  high fan-out communications requirements of large-scale workstation
  environments.  It is designed as a suite of "layered services" based
  on a reliable, authenticated notice protocol.  Multiple, redundant
  Zephyr servers provide basic routing, queueing, and dispatching
  services to clients that communicate via the Zephyr Client Library.
  More advanced communication services are bnuilt upon this base.
