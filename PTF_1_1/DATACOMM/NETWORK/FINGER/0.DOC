Description:    finger - GNU finger

Version:        1.0b

Notes:

  GNU Finger is a utility program designed to allow users of Unix hosts on
  the Internet network to get information about each other. It is a direct
  replacement for the Berkeley 4.3 finger code.

  Why Another Finger?
  ===================

  Originally, each host on the Internet network consisted of a single,
  reasonably powerful computer, capable of handling many users at the same
  time.  Typically, a "site" (physical location of computer users) would
  have only one or two computers, even if they had 20 or more people who
  used them.  If a user at site A wanted to know about users logged on at
  site B, a simple program could be invoked to query the host at site B
  about the users which were logged on.

  With the onset of more-power-per-person computing, the mainframe
  has been set aside.  A modern computing facility usually consists
  of one user per host, and many hosts per site.  This makes it a
  trial to find out about logged on users at another site, since you
  must query each host to find out about the single user who is
  logged on.  If the site had 20 hosts, you would have to invoke a
  finger program 20 times just to find out who was logged on!

  GNU Finger is a simple and effective way around this problem.  For
  sites with many hosts, a single host may be designated as the
  finger "server" host.  This host collects information about who is
  logged on to other hosts at that site.  If a user at site A wants
  to know about users logged on at site B, only the server host need
  be queried, instead of each host at that site.  This is very
  convenient.

  GNU Finger is also a direct replacement for the existing finger
  programs.  Since the finger "protocol" (rules for communication) is
  very simple, GNU Finger follows that protocol in responding to
  simple requests.  But GNU Finger also implements another protocol
  which allows two finger programs to exchange information in a
  predetermined way, which allows faster and wider bandwidth
  communication.

  A definition for the passing graphic images is built on the new
  protocol.  A user at site A (e.g. MIT) may now see the picture of a
  user at site B (e.g. UCSB), simply by typing a finger request!  The
  conversion of graphic data from one format to another is done
  through GNU Finger; no site need know where or how such images are
  stored on any other site to be able to display those images.

  Finger delivers information about users in varying formats,
  depending on how it is invoked.  `finger' invoked with no switch
  arguments performs a *site wide* finger request, no matter which
  machine it has been invoked from.  Switch arguments exist for
  getting the ``long'' form of finger information and for getting
  information only about the local machine.

  If a user on host A wants to know about a user on host B, Finger
  must make a network "connection" to host B.  If host B is running a
  finger program, that program is asked to relay information about
  the user in question through the connection back to host A, where
  Finger can display it.

  GNU Finger also runs a "server" process on a given host, whose job
  is to keep track of which users are logged in to local machines.
