Description:    SOS - Stan's Own (NFS) Server

Version:        Mar  7  1989 (?)

Notes:

  We have designed a file server conforming to the NFS protocol (version 2),
  that runs on the IBM PC.  This allows a dedicated PC to perform a task
  otherwise required of a Sun workstation running NFS in kernel, or a VAX
  running a user-level NFS daemon.  The original project intended for a PC
  to serve files from an optical disk to a heterogeneous network of Suns
  and PCs (with PC-NFS) as clients.

  For convenience, we have included the DOS executable as well.
