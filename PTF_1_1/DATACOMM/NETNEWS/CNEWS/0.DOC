Version:	27-Aug-1991

Notes:
 
  C news is a re-write, from scratch, of the `transport layer' of the Usenet
  software.  C rnews runs at over 19 times the speed of B rnews;  C expire
  runs in minutes rather than the hours taken by B expire.  These performance
  improvements were (mostly) quite simple and straightforward, and they
  exemplify general principles of performance tuning.
