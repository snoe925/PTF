Package:	datacomm/netnews/tmnn

Description:	tmnn - Teenage Mutant Ninja Netnews

Version:	B3.0 (beta level 7.8)

Notes:

  A major new release of the netnews software is about to be unloosed upon the
  net.world -- yes, after two years of development the software construct
  known as TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA NETNEWS has escaped from the secret
  laboratories of Thyrsus Enterprises and will soon assume a very public
  identity as News 3.0.

  The new release is more than just a set of patches -- it's a complete
  from-the-ground-up rewrite of the entire suite with loads of new and
  powerful features (but, of course, protocol-compatible with all B and C
  news versions).  It is much easier to install, configure and administer
  than any previous version. And it offers beleaguered news.readers better
  ways of tracking discussions, winnowing chaff, and coping with a huge
  and increasing news volume.

  The code is carefully modularized in accordance with abstract-data-type
  design principles, lavishly commented for comprehensibility, and
  accompanied by a full set of documents detailing installation, usage and
  the architecture internals.
