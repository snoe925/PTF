Description:	On-line (Interactive) Data Comm. Tools

Notes:

  Although UNIX comes with tip(1) and/or cu(1), there are many reasons why one
  would want alternative interactive data communication tools.  The system on
  the other end of the wire may not run UNIX, error-correction may be needed,
  etc.
