Package:	pgm_tool/cvs

Description:	cvs - Concurrent Version System

Version:	1.2

Notes:

  CVS is a freely available collection of programs that provide for software
  release and revision control functions in a UNIX environment.  It is
  designed to work on top of the RCS distribution, V4 (uses the V4 branch
  support).  CVS does understand how to parse older RCS formats, but cannot
  do any of the fancier features (like vendor branch support) without RCS
  branch support.
