Package:	pgm_tool/diff

Description:	diff - GNU file difference analyzer

Version:	1.15

Notes:

  This version of diff provides all the features of BSD's diff.  It has these
  additional features:

    An input file may end in a non-newline character.  If so, its last
    line is called an incomplete line and is distinguished on output
    from a full line. ...

    A file is considered to be text if its first characters are all in the
    ISO 8859 character set; BSD's diff uses Ascii. ...
