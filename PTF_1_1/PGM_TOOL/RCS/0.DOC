Package:	pgm_tool/rcs

Description:	rcs - Revision Control System

Version:	5.6

Notes:

  The Revision Control System (RCS) manages multiple revisions of files.
  RCS automates the storing, retrieval, logging, identification, and merging
  of revisions.  RCS is useful for text that is revised frequently, for
  example programs, documentation, graphics, papers, and form letters.

  The basic user interface is extremely simple.  The novice only needs
  to learn two commands: ci(1) and co(1).  ci, short for "check in",
  deposits the contents of a file into an archival file called an RCS file.
  An RCS file contains all revisions of a particular file.  co, short for
  "check out", retrieves revisions from an RCS file.
