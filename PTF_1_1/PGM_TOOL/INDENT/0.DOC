Package:	pgm_tool/indent

Description:	indent - indent and format C program source

Version:	5.5

Notes:

  The indent program changes the appearance of a C program by inserting or
  deleting whitespace.  It can be used to make code easier to read.  It can
  also convert from one style of writing C to another.

  indent understands a substantial amount about the syntax of C, but it also
  attempts to cope with incomplete and misformed syntax.
