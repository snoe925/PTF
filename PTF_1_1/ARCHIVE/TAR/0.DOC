Description:	tar - maintain tape archives

Notes:

  Tar was originally written as a way to package multiple files and
  directories into a single tape file.  It has since become the de facto
  standard for UNIX freeware archiving.  Compressed (see archive/compress)
  tar archives are the default for most anonymous FTP sites, distribution
  tapes, etc.

  Unfortunately, while System V has a utility named "tar", it has been
  modified to such an extent that it cannot handle normal tar archives.
  Consequently, we are fortunate to have freeware versions to fall back on.
