Package:	archive/tar/gnu_tar

Description:	GNU tar(1)

Version:	1.10

Notes:

  This is GNU tar.  It is based heavily on John Gilmore's public domain
  tar, but with added features.  The manual is currently being written.
  An old manual, surely riddled with errors, is in tar.texinfo.  Please
  don't send in bug reports about that manual.  In particular, the
  mechanism for doing incremental dumps has been significantly changed.

	.../README

  John Gilmore (gnu) enhanced tar substantially.  His version contains
  error recovery, compression, and some other nifty features.  The folks
  at FSF are maintaining and improving it, but it is already the tar of
  choice for many sites.

  A hint on unpacking the packages:  If you already have compress and
  tar(1) utilities, the *.atz file(s) should serve your needs just fine.
  If not, use the *.as (shell archive) file(s) instead.
