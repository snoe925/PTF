Package:	archive/compress

Description:	compress - file compression utilities

Version:	4.0.1

Notes:

  Compress reduces the size of the named files using adaptive Lempel-Ziv
  coding.  Whenever possible, each file is replaced by one with the
  extension .Z, while keeping the same  ownership modes, access and
  modification times.  If no files are specified, the standard input is
  compressed to the standard output.  Compressed files can be restored
  to their original form using uncompress or zcat.

  For convenience, the compress source code is delivered in two forms:

    4_0_1.as        shar (shell archive)
    4_0_1.at	    tar

Language(s):	C

Requirements:	None
