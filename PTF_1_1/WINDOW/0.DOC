Description:	Window Systems

Notes:

  Window systems manage "windows" (contiguous sets of pixels) on bit-mapped
  display devices.  Some modern window systems support network protocols:
  an application on one machine may have a window on another.  Others leave
  the network details to the applications, and require the at least part of
  the application to reside on the computer having the display.
