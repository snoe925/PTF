Description:	The Andrew Distribution

Version:	Version 5.0.0 (1991)

Notes:

  Andrew is contains a raft of subsystems, but the major ones contained here
  are:

    ams	- The Andrew Message System

      The Andrew Message System (AMS) is a project with the goal of producing
      a production-quality electronic communication environment with several
      types of functionality which have hitherto either not been provided by
      electronic message systems or have been found only in experimental
      systems.  The primary contributions of the AMS are:

        Machine and location independence
        Integration of communication database
        Separation of interface from functionality
        Support for multi-media communication
        Support for coping with information flood
        Flexible Architecture

    atk - The Andrew Toolkit

      The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a user interface toolkit with two primary
      goals: (1) to support the development of stand-alone applications that
      integrate text, graphics and images in a standard, efficient user
      interface; and (2) to support the development of multi-media editors,
      that is, editors that allow users to edit text, equations, graphs,
      tables, pictures, and so forth, all in a single program.

Language(s):	C

Requirements:	X11R5

  The Andrew Distribution is portable to a number of system types.  Andrew
  is able to run on RT AOS 3.4, RT AIX 2.2.1, RS/6000 AIX3.1, PS/2 AIX1.2,
  Sun3 3.5, Sun3 4.1, Sun4 4.1, Vax Ultrix 3.1, Vax BSD, DEC MIPS, Apollo,
  HP, and Macintosh II MacMach.  We run it on RT AOS 3.4 and Sun3 3.5.

  In addition to space requirements, the distribution assumes that you
  have the X Window System Distribution from MIT, which contains the
  following files and programs:

    imake -- part of program construction (makefile) facility
    bdftosnf -- font compiler
    makedepend --part of program construction (makefile) facility
    Xlib -- X.V11 include files and libraries
