Package:	window/screen

Description:	screen - window system

Version:	2.13.2

Notes:

  "screen" is a window manager that allows you to handle several independent
  screens (UNIX ttys) on a single physical terminal; each screen has its own
  set of processes connected to it (typically interactive shells).  Each
  virtual terminal created by "screen" emulates a DEC VT100 plus several ANSI
  X3.64 and ISO 2022 functions (including DEC VT102 features such as line and
  character deletion and insertion).

Language(s):    C

Requirements:

  Since "screen" uses pseudo-ttys, the select system call, and UNIX-domain
  sockets, it will not run under a system that does not include these
  features of 4.2 and 4.3 BSD UNIX.
