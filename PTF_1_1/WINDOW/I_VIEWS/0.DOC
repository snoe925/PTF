Description:	InterViews - window-based appl. env.

Version:	3.0

Notes:

  InterViews is a software system for window-based applications.  Like most
  user environments, InterViews is object-oriented in that components such
  as windows, buttons, menus, and documents are active elements with
  inherited behavior.  The name InterViews comes from the idea of a user
  interface object presenting an interactive view of some data.  For example,
  a text editor implements an interactive view of the contents of a text file.

  InterViews is a system for building and using interactive software.
  Written in C++, InterViews provides a set of C++ class libraries
  with high-level abstractions for implementing interactive programs.

  graphics, sophisticated document formatting, and graphical connectivity.
  InterViews currently runs on top of the X window system.
