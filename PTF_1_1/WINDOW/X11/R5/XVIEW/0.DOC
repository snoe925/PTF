Package:	window/x11/r5/xview

Description:	XView - SunView-like API

Version:	?

Notes:

  XView provides a SunView-like programming interface for producing Open
  Look applications.  Although it is very useful for converting programs
  from SunView to Open Look, it is also a convenient way of producing new
  Open Look programs.  (Typical XView code is less than half the size of
  equivalent OLIT code.)  XView has some restrictions, to be sure, but
  they won't be hit by the usual run of relatively simple applications.

  The XView code is stored in a few major directories:

    .../r5/mit/con_2	contrib/extensions/xv/		???

    .../r5/mit/con_3	contrib/lib/xview3/
    .../r5/mit/con_3	contrib/lib/i18nXView2/

Language(s):    C

Requirements:   bit-mapped printing or display device
