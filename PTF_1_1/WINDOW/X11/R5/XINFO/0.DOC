Package:	window/x11/r5/xinfo

Description:	xinfo - X Info Widget

Version:	1.01.01

Notes:

  This is the latest, and hopefully last, major release of the Info widget
  posted on two other occasions to comp.sources.x. I will continute to
  provide fixes and small functionality updates as necessary, of course,
  but feel that this is now as featureful as it needs to be, given its
  intended use.

  ...

  This directory contains the sources for an "Emacs Info" browsing widget,
  subclassed from the Composite widget.
