Package:	window/x11/r5/mit

Description:	X Window System, Version 11 (MIT files)

Version:	r5

Notes:

  Release 5 is the latest version of X11.  It adds scalable fonts, PEX (PHIGS
  Extension to X), and some other niceties.  Mostly, however, it continues to
  represent the flowering of the X user and programmer communities.

  Because of the size and complexity of X11R5, the distribution is split up
  into a number of pieces.  This is a slight nuisance for folks who want the
  whole thing, but greatly speeds up the process of extracting parts of the
  distribution.  Hint: Grab _etc_.at first...

Language(s):	C, C++, etc.

Requirements:	Bit-mapped display, mouse, etc.

Origin:		MIT Software Distribution Center
