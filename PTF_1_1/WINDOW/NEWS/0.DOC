Description:	NeWS - Network/extensible Window System

Notes:

  In October 1986, Sun Microsystems announced NeWS (Network/extensible Window
  System), a synthesis of the window server and page-description language
  technologies.  NeWS makes the device-independent, powerful imaging model of
  the PostScript language available in a distributed window system.  A key
  innovation is the use of the PostScript language, together with NeWS
  extensions, as a window system extension language, which makes possible a
  new level of interactive performance and flexibility.  NeWS provides a
  platform, independent of hardware and operating systems, on which highly
  diverse window applications and user interfaces can be built.  NeWS
  applications attain an unprecedented level of visual quality, and exploit a
  coherency of network design new to window-based applications.
