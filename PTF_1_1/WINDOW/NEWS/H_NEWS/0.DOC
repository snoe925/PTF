Description:	HyperNeWS - window-based appl. env.

Version:	1.4

Notes:

  HyperNeWS provides a number of object types, such as buttons, sliders,
  menus, etc. These can be used to design an interface to a program
  written in C, Prolog or Common Lisp.  The program is referred to as a
  ``client'' of the HyperNeWS server.  All interface objects used by a
  client exist on a ``stack'' to which the client must ``connect'' before
  it can access the objects.
 
  All objects communicate with each other and the client using messages.
  The client can read or set the value associated with a particular object
  at any time by sending an appropriate message to the object. The client
  can also be put into ``listen'' mode where it waits until a message
  arrives from one of the interface objects.
