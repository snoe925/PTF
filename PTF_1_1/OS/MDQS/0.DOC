Package:	os/mdqs

Description:	MDQS - Multi-Device Queueing System

Version:	2.13

Notes:

  MDQS was designed with almost everything in mind.  What we currently have
  is a system to handle a variety of line printer devices (e.g. Dataproducts,
  Printronix, Versatec, etc.), phototypesetting emulation via an interface
  to VCAT, laser printers (e.g., Imagen), and batch requests in a fairly
  civilized manner.  There is also a ``network'' pseudo device that is used
  to send requests to remote machines for processing.  There are currently
  network interfaces for Berkeley 2.8BSD TCP/IP, Berkeley 4.2BSD TCP/IP,
  and UUCP (not fully tested).
