Package:	os/mach

Description:	The Mach operating system

Version:	Research Distribution of Mach 3.0

Notes:

  The Mach operating system, developed at Carnegie-Mellon University,
  targets a broad range of computer architectures, including uniprocessor,
  multiprocessor, and distributed systems.  The designers of Mach intend to
  produce a compact, efficient kernel on top of which may be layered inter-
  faces for traditional operating systems such as 4.3BSD, System V, MS-DOS,
  VMS, etc.  Most traditional kernel support, such as device drivers and
  filesystem handling, will be provided by a set of user-level servers.  The
  Mach kernel will provide the mechanisms necessary for simple operation in
  a distributed environment using uniprocessor or multiprocessor systems.
  Mach currently provides full backward compatibility with 4.3BSD.
  
	Introduction, Mach/4.3BSD: A Conservative Approach to Parallelism


  The  Mach  3.0  micro-kernel provides the following functions: virtual
  memory management, inter-process communication, tasks, threads, exceptions,
  scheduling primitives and device drivers.

  It  does  not  provide  a file system, tty i/o, network support or other
  Unix features like signal and Unix tasks. The pure kernel alone does not
  give you  a usable operating system.
