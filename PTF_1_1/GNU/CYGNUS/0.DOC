Description:	Cygnus Vintage GNU Release

Version:	911206	(December 6, 1991)

Notes:

  Cygnus Support provides support for GNU Software.  As a small sideline,
  they produced this "vintage" release.  You can buy the release on a tape,
  with a nifty manual and some start-up help, from Cygnus.  Or, by their
  gracious cooperation, you can use the copy here.  Along with source code,
  the release includes binaries for Sun-3s and Sun-4s.  Enjoy.  

  P.S.  Unpack _etc_.atz and look over the README.  The original Install
  file (included) is for the Cygnus tape, and won't work on our archive at
  all.  Look at Install.ptf, and see if you can make our hacks work.  We
  pretend that the archive file is a tape drive, and disable bogus tape
  commands.  This may work.  Otherwise, you're on your own...
