ISODE

  The ISODE distribution is available in two forms:

    Anonymous FTP	If you can FTP to the ARPA Internet, use anonymous
			FTP to the ARPAnet host louie.udel.edu (10.0.0.96)
			and retrieve the file portal/isode-1.tar.  This is
			a 2.0MB tar(1) image.

			Alternately, the file "portal/isode-1.tar.Z" can be
			retrieved which contains a compressed version of the
			tar file, and is about 0.8MB in size.

    Magnetic tape	Otherwise, send a magnetic tape with a self-addressed
			mailing label to:

      Postal address:	Northrop Research and Technology Center
			Attn: Automation Sciences Laboratory (0330/T30)
			One Research Park
			Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA  90274
			USA
      Telephone:	+1-213/544-5393
      Internet Mailbox: Bug-ISODE@NRTC.NORTHROP.COM

			The lab will send back the tape in tar(1) format at
			1600bpi, along with a copy of the User's Manual.
