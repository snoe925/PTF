Cygnus Support


cygnus
------

  Cygnus Support was founded in 1989 to provide commercial support for free
  software.  Cygnus supplies products and services that benefit advanced
  development groups by allowing them to use state-of-the-art tools without
  having to maintain them.  With Cygnus Support, sites that once were forced
  to do their own tool support can recover that valuable staff time.  Former
  users of proprietary software now may choose supported free software,
  combining the advantages of both worlds.

  Free software is faster, more powerful, and more portable than its
  proprietary counterparts.  It evolves faster because users who want to make
  improvements are free to do so.  Cygnus tracks these improvements and
  integrates them into tested, stable versions ready for commercial use, then
  backs this software with comprehensive support.

  With Cygnus Support as your partner, you will have the software and the
  support you need to meet your business objectives better.  Cygnus is
  intimately familiar with this software from extensive experience using,
  debugging, and implementing it.  You will get direct access to the most
  qualified support people: the authors of that software.

  We provide "vintage" releases -- stable versions which have been through
  extensive use and testing -- or up-to-the-minute "progressive" sources,
  for those who need the very latest version.

  Because all our improvements are also free software, you can distribute
  them widely within your organization, or to your customers, without extra
  cost.

  NOTE:  Do not call Cygnus expecting free support; they are too busy
  helping paying customers.  On the other hand, you may want to consider
  buying some help from them, if your investment in GNU freeware is large.
