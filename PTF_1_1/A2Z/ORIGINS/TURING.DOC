HyperNeWS
---------

  We hope that you enjoy using HyperNeWS1.4, and if you have comments,
  we'd be happy to hear from you.  We can be reached via

    newsdev@turing.ac.uk

  Just a note to let you know that we have just released HyperNeWS 1.4
  for OpenWindows 2.0.

    I took the liberty of uploading it onto uunet.uu.net as
    tmp/HyperNeWS1.4.tar.Z (I hope this isn't a bad breech of etiquette).
    If you could put it somewhere sensible and let us know how others can
    access it, we would be eternally grateful.  Please spread HyperNeWS
    as widely as you can/like!!!
