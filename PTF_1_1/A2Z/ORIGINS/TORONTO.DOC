C-NEWS
------

  C News has been tested pretty thoroughly.  We're also thoroughly sick of
  it and make no promises that there will ever be another release.  We may,
  repeat *may*, provide updates via some appropriate newsgroup (currently
  the best choice is "news.software.b", although there is some sentiment for
  folding all the subgroups there into just "news.software"; we oppose
  creation of "news.software.c" because we don't think there will be enough
  traffic to justify a whole newsgroup).

  If you've found a problem, we definitely do want to hear about it.  But,
  we *do not* want to see 2000 lines of diff listing!  What we want to see
  is a concise human-readable description of what the problem is and how, 
  if at all, you solved it.  If we want the diff listing, we will ask.
  Similarly, we are interested in hearing about changes and improvements,
  but want to see terse descriptions first.

  If you want us to consider changes/fixes/etc, send them to us, don't just
  post them to the net.  We don't necessarily read all possibly-relevant
  groups.  Only postings from us are officially part of C News.

  To send comments, complaints, problem reports, etc., do *not* mail to
  Geoff or Henry personally, but to:

          c-news@zoo.toronto.edu
  aka     c-news@zoo.utoronto.ca
  aka     utzoo!c-news

  (Note that this has changed, c-news used to be on utstat.)  Utzoo connects
  to half the known universe (well, not quite, but try via allegra, att,
  attcan, decvax, floyd, hoptoad, kitty, linus, mnetor, pyramid, suncan, utai,
  utgpu, watmath, or yunexus).

  The current C News distribution can currently always be retrieved by
  anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.toronto.edu in file pub/c-news/c-news.Z (a shell
  archive) or pub/c-news/c-news.tar.Z (a tar archive) and the complete set
  of patches can also be found on ftp.cs.toronto.edu in the directory
  pub/c-news/patches.  FTP during our peak hours (12h00-17h00 Eastern) is
  not encouraged.
