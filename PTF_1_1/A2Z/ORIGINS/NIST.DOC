EXPECT
------

  expect may be ftp'd as pub/expect.shar.Z from durer.cme.nist.gov.
  Request email delivery by mailing to "library@cme.nist.gov".  The
  contents of the message should be (no subject line) "send
  pub/expect.shar.Z".  Once you have retrieved the system, please read
  the INSTALL file.  The papers mentioned above can be retrieved
  separately as pub/expect.ps.Z and pub/expect-sysadm.ps.Z.

  The expect program requires Tcl (which you may already have).  (The
  expect library does not need Tcl.)  Tcl may be retrieved as
  pub/tcl.tar.Z in the same way as described above for expect.  I am
  told that it runs on SV with minor modifications (although I don't
  know what they are - sorry).  When new releases of Tcl appear from
  Berkeley, I will try to check them out for expect as soon as possible.
  If you would like to get the newest Tcl release without waiting, ftp
  pub/tcl.tar.Z from ucbvax.berkeley.edu.  You may request email copies
  of Tcl by writing to ouster@sprite.berkeley.edu.

  expect is known to work on BSD systems and will probably work on all
  BSD-derived systems.  expect works on SVR4 systems and earlier
  releases of SV which support the system calls: select or poll.
  Systems which do not support these can run expect, but without the job
  control facility.  Minor work is left to make this feature work on
  System V.3.  No coding has been done for POSIX, though I have set up
  templates, and only minor work should be necessary.  (See the Makefile
  for more info.)  I would be willing to work with you to complete a
  port.
 
  Although I can't promise anything in the way of support, I'd be
  interested to hear about your experiences using it (either good or
  bad).  I'm also interested in hearing bug reports (please include
  version # reported by expect -d) and suggestions for improvement even
  though I can't promise to implement them immediately.

  Please send money, love letters, and bug reports to:
