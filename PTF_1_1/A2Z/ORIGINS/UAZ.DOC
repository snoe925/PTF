  Doubtless you will find problems, more options not discussed in the
  documentation, and just general indications that this program was
  written late at night after I was done all my serious work for the
  day :-).  If - no, when - this happens, I encourage you to drop me a
  line.  I'd like to know about any flaws you run into, especially
  major, systemic ones.

  Generally, I really hope that the bugs will not prove too annoying,
  and that the package will prove generally useful to you the user,
  and, if you place it in a public directory, to anyone else who
  might happen to try it out.

  SB-Prolog is no longer actively supported at the University
  of Arizona.  We believe there is some development work that is
  going on at SUNY Stony Brook, where SB-Prolog originated: you
  might try sending e-mail to warren@sbcs.sunysb.edu if you have
  questions.
