GENESIS
-------

  This document describes the GENESIS system for function optimization
  based on genetic search techniques.  Genetic algorithms appear to hold a
  lot of promise as general purpose adaptive search procedures.  However,
  the author disclaims any warranties of fitness for any particular
  problem.  The purpose of making this system available is to encourage
  the experimental use of genetic algorithms on realistic optimization
  problems, and thereby to identify the strengths and weaknesses of
  genetic algorithms.  Comments and bug reports are also welcome.
