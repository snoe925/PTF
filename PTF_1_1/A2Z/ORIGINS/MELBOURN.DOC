CAP
---

  The primary source of CAP information is, as always, the network newsgroup
  comp.protocols.appletalk.  This forum will continue to be used to disseminate
  information about CAP 6.0 updates, but we would very much like to encourage a
  slightly more formal approach to the process of propogating CAP patches.

  Therefore, please send patches for CAP bug-fixes and new features to

    cap@munnari.OZ.AU

  Patches are archived at

    munnari.OZ.AU           mac/cap.patches
    rutgers.EDU             src/cap60.patches
    gatekeeper.DEC.COM      pub/net/cap/cap.patches
