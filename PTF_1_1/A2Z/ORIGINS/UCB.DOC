  The Computer Science Research Group (CSRG) has produced a sequence of
  UNIX releases, of which BSD 4.4 is the latest.  They were an early
  focal point for UNIX development, and have brought (through invention
  or adoption) a wide variety of programs into UNIX.


Empire
------

  If you have a problem with Empire, and want some semantic changed,
  change it yourself!  In the past, changes to the master copy of the
  source came fast and furious, and were mostly untested.  A stricter
  policy is now in force, with major semantic changes requiring
  significant playtesting, discussion, and documenation before being
  integrated to the main game source.

  Without doubt there are dozens if not hundreds of bugs left in the game.
  Empire was playtested at Berkeley this past summer (1989), but many bugs
  still remain.  Major bugs (something that causes a core-dump or other
  dramatic termination, or results in players being able to arbitrarily
  manufacture game items) will be fixed and integrated as quickly as
  possible, and patches will be distributed.  Major bug reports should
  include all possible information, preferably with a fix attached.  
  Reproduction of bugs that depend on your particular machine and empire 
  game will be difficult if not impossible for me to perform.

  Bugs which are not classed as "major" will be noted, but not integrated
  or distributed until a major release occurs.

  The current documentation is definitely out-of-date.  We're working
  on it.  (One thing you should know about Empire -- the documentation
  is *always* out-of-date).  Documentation patches will be sent seperately
  from code changes.

  If you have a bug report, you should send it to me.  If the bug report
  is unclear, it probably won't be fixed unless I have the time to eyeball
  the code in question.  My mail address is

        mr-frog@scam.berkeley.edu

  A final note; the fact that my name (and Peter's) appears at
  the top is because we've done the most work.  This should not take
  away from the contributions which dozens of people have made to
  the game over the four years it has been around.  The list of
  contributors is located in the doc directory, entitled CREDITS.

TCL, TK
-------

  I can't promise to provide a lot of help to people trying to use Tcl, but
  I am interested in hearing about bugs or suggestions for improvements.
  Send them to me at "ouster@sprite.berkeley.edu".

  There exists a mail distribution list for the exchange of information
  about Tcl, Tk, and their applications.  If you would like to be added
  to this mailing list, send an e-mail message to
  "tcl-request@sprite.berkeley.edu"

TIFF
----

  This is PD software for reading and writing Tagged Image File Format (TIFF).
  Source is in v2.2.tar.Z and sample images are in v2.2pics.tar.Z

  The files are compressed tar files.  Copy the stuff you want to a UNIX
  system and
    uncompress v2.2.tar.Z
    tar xvf v2.2.tar
    (or similar).

  There is also a mailing list for people that use the software:
  tiff@ucbvax.berkeley.edu.  If you want to get on the list, send a
  note to tiff-request@ucbvax.berkeley.edu.
