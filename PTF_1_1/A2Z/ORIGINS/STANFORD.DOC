InterViews
----------

  InterViews is a research project with participation from both Stanford and
  Silicon Graphics.  We (the researchers) fix bugs, generate new releases,
  write documentation, give tutorials, and try to answer questions as best as
  we can.  Quest Systems, a small company in Santa Clara, now offers support
  for InterViews (their product is called ObjectViews).  Other companies are
  considering offering a product based on InterViews.
