BTOOL
-----

  This note announces the public availability of version 1.3 of a tool
  for measuring the branch coverage of C programs.  The tool was written
  by Thomas Hoch, K. Wolfram Schafer (University of Illinois), and Brian
  Marick (Motorola).
 
  The tool is suitable for use in production environments.  However, it
  is unsupported and comes with no warranty. A mailing list is available
  for mutual support (see below); I will read it and I may fix bugs or
  documentation in my spare time.
  
  If you're using these tools, please let me know:

NCSA

  During the first half of July, we released Version 3.1 of HDF.  

  The differences between HDF 3.0 and HDF 3.1 are not major.  (See 
  the list below.)  If you have been using HDF 3.0, you should not 
  need to change anything to your code or to the way you compile and 
  link programs that invoke HDF.  If you have a program that runs 
  correctly with HDF 3.0 but does not run correctly under HDF 3.1,  
  let us know immediately.  (mfolk@ncsa.uiuc.edu (217-244-0647) or 
  clow@ncsa.uiuc.edu (217-2440014))
