Notes:

  The files in this directory describe authors or institutions whose software
  is found on the disc.  These people should not be contacted frivolously, but
  they are frequently glad to hear about bugs, fixes, enhancements, etc.  You
  may be able to get timely access to updates and/or patches by contacting the
  maintainer or by using FTP (over the Internet).
