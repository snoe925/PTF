CLU

  CLU is no longer licensed.  See ~CLU/COPYRIGHT for distribution information.

  If you have problems with this distribution, you can call Paul Johnson or
  Dorothy Curtis at (617) 253-1945 to get help.  If you find bugs, please
  tell us about them, either in writing or by sending network mail to
  PRJ@PM-PRJ.LCS.MIT.EDU and/or DCurtis@MESON.LCS.MIT.EDU.  We do not have
  the time or the staff for "releases"; you will have to either FTP a new
  copy or request a distribution tape (for a fee) periodically.  The sytem
  is quite stable; no changes other than bug fixes are contemplated.  We are
  now hard at work on Argus, the distributed computing successor to CLU.

  ... If the reader has been confused by all of this, one of the CLU group
  should be consulted (actually, an ambitious hacker can just go and try
  things to see if they work).  Questions are best addressed to Bob Scheifler
  (RWS  at  MIT-XX  or MIT-BOLD)  and  Paul Johnson (PRJOHNSON@MIT-XX).  We
  can be reached by phone at (617) 253-1945.

    covers general language issues, relevant to all the
    implementations of the scheme language (MIT Scheme, Yale
    University's T, Indiana University's Scheme84, Semantic
    Microsystems' MacScheme, and Texas Instruments' PC Scheme
    among others).
