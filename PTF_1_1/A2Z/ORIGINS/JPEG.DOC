  This software is still undergoing revision.  Updated versions may be
  obtained by anonymous FTP to uunet.uu.net; look under directory
  /graphics/jpeg.  This particular version will be archived as
  jpegsrc.v1.tar.Z.  If you don't have access to Internet FTP, UUNET's
  archives are also available via UUCP; contact postmaster@uunet.uu.net
  for information on retrieving files that way.

  Please report any problems with this software to jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.

  If you intend to become a serious user of this software, please contact
  jpeg-info@uunet to be added to our electronic mailing list.  Then you'll be
  notified of updates and have a chance to participate in discussions, etc.

  This software is the work of Tom Lane, Philip Gladstone, Luis Ortiz, and other
  members of the independent JPEG group.

  ...

  We'd appreciate it if people would compile and check out the code on as
  wide a variety of systems as possible, and report any portability problems
  encountered (with solutions, if possible).  Checks of file compatibility
  with other JPEG implementations would also be of interest.  Finally, we
  would appreciate code profiles showing where the most time is spent,
  especially on unusual systems.

  Please send bug reports, offers of help, etc. to jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.
