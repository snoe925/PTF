AKCL
----

  There are source files on cli.com:akcl/akcl-XX.tar.Z You probably
  want the highest XX version number.  For example akcl-1-65.tar.Z would
  allow you to build the version 1.65 of AKCL.  In the following the
  compressed tar file is simply referred to as akcl.tar.Z You will also
  need to obtain the original kcl distribution of June 1987.  That is
  referred to as kcl.tar.Z and is also available on cli.com and
  rascal.ics.utexas.edu.
                                   
  If you cannot obtain these files via internet, a cartridge tape (sun
  compatible) or diskettes containing akcl, and kcl sources may be
  obtained for $250 US plus shipping, from J. Schelter, 1715
  Barnswallow, Autin TX 78746.  This would be in standard tar format.
  Some machines on which akcl compiles are 386 under System V (eg
  Microport), Sun's (sparc,sun3's), HP under hpux and 4.3.  An older
  version of sources is also available from Austin Code Works, 11100
  Leafwood Ln., Austin TX 78750.  Tel:(512) 258-0785.
