atree
-----

  Until the advent of commercial software and harware, I extend my best
  wishes for success in using the atree release 2.0 package!  Please try
  a few experiments by just changing the given sample programs first.
  After you gain confidence, I hope you will try some really exciting
  projects.  Please let me know about your experiences, so future
  adaptive logic networks can be better.
