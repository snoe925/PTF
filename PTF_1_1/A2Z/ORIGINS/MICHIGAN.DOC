  Ok... Well, I've had this for a while, and it works for me, but if somehow
  I've goofed, let me know.

Oh yeah - this program may be distributed freely so long as you don't
modify it in any way. You may not charge for distributing it. (Don't
feel bad, I can't charge for it either. }-) It'd be nice if you kept
this and the other enclosed doc files with it when distributing, but
I'm not going to make a fuss about it. Most people are so familiar
with the program by now that it wouldn't matter much anyway. You
should keep this README file around, so bug reports & such will find
their way back to me. (Bugs? What bugs? Nah, there aren't any bugs...)
