GENESIS
-------

  This directory contains the final release of the source code for the "free" 
  version of the GENESIS simulation package.   This code is intended to give 
  interested parties as taste of the GENESIS simulation package.  In addition 
  to the source code which makes up the basic package, this distribution
  includes a number of small simulations built with GENESIS (located beneath
  the directory /usr/genesis/Scripts).   These are intended as tutorial
  examples which can demonstrate both the types of neurological simulations
  which can be modeled with the system as well as the look and feel of XODUS,
  the graphical front-end for the package.   These tutorials require that
  /usr/genesis/genesis be built and installed, and that /usr/genesis be in
  the users path before execution.

 This distribution has been compiled and tested on Sun 3s, Sun 386is, Sun 4s, 
 SPARCstation 1s, SPARCstation 1+'s, DECstation 3100s and DECstation 5000s.
 It should function with either X11R3, X11R4 or DECwindows under SUN OS
 4.0 (or greater) or Ultrix 3.1.

 Over the coming years Caltech will continue to develop the simulation package.
 Parties interested in using the package for neural modeling development
 may wish join us in our development efforts.   We will supply such parties 
 with updated source code, documentation, and additional computational models
 as they become available.   A one time annoyance fee of $200.00 has been 
 associated with "membership" in this group.   For more details see the 
 remainder of this README file.

  In addition to distributing GENESIS we have also established a GENESIS
  users group (BABEL) for those interested in developing new GENESIS
  applications.  Membership in BABEL requires that a one time $200
  registration fee payable to the California Institute of Technology be sent
  to BABEL, c/o Jim Bower, Computational Neural Systems Program, 216-76,
  Caltech, Pasadena, CA, 91125.  As a registered user, one is provided
  documentation on the simulator itself (currently in an early stage), has
  access to additional simulator components, bug reports, and a user's bulletin 
  board.  In addition we are establishing a depository for interesting
  completed simulations.   BABEL is still currently in it's early stages, but
  we plan to have a secondary release of the GENESIS system done by early 
  October, 1990.   This secondary release will only be distributed to BABEL
  users.

  Full source for the simulator is available via FTP from
  genesis.cns.caltech.edu (131.215.135.64).   To acquire the software
  use TELNET to connect to genesis.cns.caltech.edu and login as the
  user genesis (no password required).  If you answer all the questions
  asked of you an 'ftp' account will automatically be created for you.
  You can then 'ftp' back to the machine and download the software.  If you do
  not have network access the necessary tapes can be provided for a small 
  handling fee.  Those requiring tapes should send requests plus $50 payable
  to Caltech at the address listed above.  Any other questions about the
  system or its distribution should also be sent to genesis@caltech.bitnet.
