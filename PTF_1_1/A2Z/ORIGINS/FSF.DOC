For any GNU programs without specific sections below, refer to the "default"
notes at the end of this file.


bash (GNU Bourne Again Shell)
-----------------------------

  Bug reports for 1.10 should be sent to:

        bash-maintainers@ai.mit.edu

  The discussion list "bug-bash@ai.mit.edu" often contains information
  about new ports of Bash, or discussions of new features or behaviour
  changes that people would like.  This mailing list is also available
  as a news feed in gnu.bash.bug.

  When you send a bug report to bash-maintainers@ai.mit.edu, please
  include:

    * the version number of Bash
    * the machine and OS that it is running on (see .machine or .made)
    * a description of the bug
    * a recipe for recreating the bug reliably
    * a fix for the bug if you have one!

  While the maintainers of Bash do not promise to fix all bugs, we would
  like this shell to be the best that we can make it.

cvs (Concurrent Version System)
-------------------------------

  PLEASE report any problems to me, berliner@sun.com (Brian Berliner)
  and I will try to collect patches and enhancements into future CVS
  distributions.  "patch" format files are best, using context diffs,
  if you will.

  GOOD LUCK!

  Brian Berliner
  berliner@sun.com


dld (dynamic link/unlink editor)
--------------------------------

  I've received quite a number of suggestions for improvements, new features,
  and debugging support.  I'll incorporate them in release 3.3--whenever I
  have time to work on it!

g_script (GNU PostScript)
-------------------------

  If you have problems with Ghostscript, contact

    Aladdin Enterprises
    P.O. box 60264
    Palo Alto, CA 94306
    (415)322-0103
    ...{uunet,decwrl}!aladdin!ghost
    ghost@aladdin.com

  The best times to call on the phone are 8:30-11:30 AM Monday-Friday;
  at other times you may get an answering machine.  Only use the
  Internet if your organization or activity allows this -- the UUCP
  path works just as well, but may take longer.

  If you report a problem, please specify which version of Ghostscript
  you are running, and the hardware, operating system, window system,
  and C compiler you are using, and be as specific as you can about the
  problem -- this will help us a lot in tracking it down.  We want
  Ghostscript to be a high-quality product, and will do our best to fix
  any reported problem.


g_st (GNU SmallTalk)
---------------------

  GNU Smalltalk version 1.1.1
  by Steve Byrne

  To report bugs or suggestions (or even offer assistance :-) ), send mail
  to bug-gnu-smalltalk@prep.ai.mit.edu.  Bugs reported here will be echoed
  to the gnu.smalltalk.bug newsgroup.


gas (GNU as)
------------

  Bugs in gas should be reported to bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu
  If you can't get through to prep, try hack@gnu.ai.mit.edu or
  hack@media-lab.media.mit.edu

  If you report a bug in GAS, please remember to include:

    A description of exactly what went wrong.

    The type of machine GAS was running on (VAX, 68020, etc),

    The Operating System GAS was running under.

    The options given to GAS.

    The actual input file that caused the problem.

    It is silly to report a bug in GAS without including an input file for
    GAS.  Don't ask us to generate the file just because you made it from
    files you think we have access to.

      1. You might be mistaken.

      2. It might take us a lot of time to install things to regenerate that
         file.

      3. We might get a different file from the one you got, and might not
         see any bug.

    To save us these delays and uncertainties, always send the input file
    for the program that failed.

    If the input file is very large, and you are on the internet, you may
    want to make it avaliable for anonymous FTP instead of mailing it.  If
    you do, include instructions for FTP'ing it in your bug report.

gnu_m4 (GNU m4)
---------------

  Send bug reports to me (Rene' Seindal, email: seindal@diku.dk) or to
  bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu.

  ALL bug reports should include:

    * The version number of m4
    * The hardware and operating system
    * The compiler used to compile
    * A description of the bug behaviour
    * The input to m4, that triggered the bug
    * A transcript of the output from m4

  If I can't reproduce the bug, there is really not much I can do about it.

  Again, since I have no access to System V machines, I can't do much about
  bugs, that are System V specific, unless, of course, the bug reports are
  accompanied by patches/fixes.

gnuplot (GNU graphics utilities)
---------------------------------

  see a2z/origins/pixar.doc


graphics (GNU graphics utilities)
---------------------------------

  The alpha distribution is available via anonymous ftp from
  qed.rice.edu (128.42.4.38) in /pub/graphics.tar.Z.  Ready to print
  documentation in postscript form is in /pub/graphics.ps.Z, and
  info-ized documentation is in /pub/info/graphics.info.

  Comments, suggestions and bug reports (please specify your machine
  architecture and operating system version) are welcome.  Send them to
  Rich@Rice.edu, or bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu.


groff (GNU troff)
-----------------

  Please report bugs using the form in the file BUG-REPORT; the idea of
  this is to make sure that I have all the information I need to fix the
  bug.  At the very least, read the BUG-REPORT form and make sure that
  you supply all the information that it asks for.  Even if you are not
  sure that something is a bug, report it using BUG-REPORT: this will
  enable me to determine whether it really is a bug or not.  As well as
  bug reports, I would be interested in suggestions for improvements to
  groff (no matter how small).

ispell (GNU spelling checker)
-----------------------------

  My eternal gratitude to the author of ispell -- I don't know how I
  ever lived without it.  I received his permission to post ispell to
  the net and have added a GNU EMACS interface.  Look in the file
  ispell.el for installation instructions.

  As far as I know, no one informally "supports" this program.  If you
  would like to "adopt" it (collect fixes/enhancements and post a new
  version periodically), feel free to do so.

  I volunteer to collect dictionary diffs and post a composite diff
  periodically.  If you add a lot of words to the main dictionary, send
  me the diffs between the the modified dictionary and the posted one.
  Also, if you have access to a TOPS20 system with a more complete
  dictionary in ispell format, send me the diffs if you can.  Just
  PLEASE don't dump an entire dictionary to our site!
 
  The dictionary posted is one I snarfed from around here -- after
  comparison with the one originally supplied, ours appears a tad more
  complete and accurate.

libg_p_p (GNU C++ library)
--------------------------

  There is now a gnu libg++ mailing list (bug-lib-g++@prep.ai.mit.edu) and
  associated usenet gnu news group.
 
  You will be performing a valuable service if you use libg++ classes and
  report back any comments, and suggestions, or bugs, preferably to the
  bug-lib-g++ list.  Your feedback is extremely helpful in efforts to make
  libg++ as useful and reliable as possible.
 
  I continue to solicit
 
    * bug reports.
    * suggestions.
    * comments.
    * questions about installing and using libg++
    * other contributions to be incorporated into libg++.
    * sample programs using libg++.
 
  Often, the best place to send such things is bug-lib-g++@prep.ai.mit.edu,
  although direct mail to me is also welcome.
 
  Good luck!

gmp (GNU MP library)
--------------------

  If you find a bug in the library, please make sure to tell us about it!

  You can report bugs, and propose modifications and enhancements to
  tege@gnu.ai.mit.edu.  How to report a bug is further described in
  the texinfo documentation, see the file gmp.texi.

oleo (GNU spreadsheet)
----------------------

  Send questions, comments, bugs, bugfixes, patches, etc to:
        hack@gnu.ai.mit.edu


patch, perl
-----------

  IMPORTANT!  Help save the world!  Communicate any problems and
  suggested patches to me, lwall@jpl-devvax.Jpl.Nasa.Gov (Larry Wall),
  so we can keep the world in sync.  If you have a problem, there's
  someone else out there who either has had or will have the same problem.

  If possible, send in patches such that the patch program will apply them.
  Context diffs are the best, then normal diffs.  Don't send ed scripts--
  I've probably changed my copy since the version you have.

  Watch for patch patches in net.sources.bugs.  Patches will generally be in
  a form usable by the patch program.  If you are just now bringing up patch
  and aren't sure how many patches there are, write to me and I'll send any
  you don't have.  Your current patch level is shown in patchlevel.h.

  Watch for perl patches in comp.lang.perl.  Patches will generally be
  in a form usable by the patch program.  If you are just now bringing up
  perl and aren't sure how many patches there are, write to me and I'll send
  any you don't have.  Your current patch level is shown in patchlevel.h.

texi2rof (TeXinfo to *roff)
---------------------------

  Please report any portability (and other) problems you encounter.

  Several people have asked me whether programs exist to convert TeX and
  LaTeX documents to troff.  I don't know of any.  If I were to write one,
  I think I would first write a customised macro package for troff that a
  texi2roff-like program would translate to.

  If someone would like to collaborate on such a project, please contact me.
