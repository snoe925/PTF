Description:	This is the top level directory of the PTF disc.

Notes:

  The sub-directory a2z contains administrative files which should be
  inspected before any attempt is made to use the disc.  In addition,
  the accompanying booklet should be read for hints on using the disc.
  The a2z directory is laid out as follows:

    a2z/
      bin			scripts for using the disc
      doc			assorted reference text files
      lists			lists of packages, etc.
      origins			information on package origins

  The remaining sub-directories are the tops of topical directory trees.
  These are (typically) structured as follows:

    a/
      0.doc			documentation file for topic a
      aa/ 
        0.doc			documentation file for topic aa
        aaa/ 
          0.doc			documentation file for package aaa
          0.lst			summary listing file for package aaa
          aaa.ltv		verbose tar(1) listing of aaa.atz
          aaa.atz		compressed tar(1) archive
      ab/ 
        ...

  There are some definite flaws with the current hierarchy.  We left some
  major collections (e.g., window/x11/r5/mit) intact, to preserve their
  structure.  In other cases (e.g., GNU), we folded collections into our
  own structure.  This may cause packages to appear in places other than
  where you might expect them.  In addition, some programs (e.g. compress)
  show up multiple times, because several collections include them.  CDROM
  real estate is cheap, so we decided to live with this.  In any event, we
  expect to rearrange things in future releases, so let us know your
  preferences...
