Description:	PlaNet - PDP Network Tool

Version:	5.6

Notes:

  The PlaNet System (Version 5.6) is a tool for constructing, running and
  examining a PDP (parallel distributed processing) or connectionist network.
  PlaNet has previously been known as SunNet.  The most significant aspect
  of PlaNet is that it allows you to deal with a network at a fairly high
  level of conceptualization, and yet provides the flexibility to construct
  networks of almost arbitrary structure and size and to run the network in
  many different ways.  You define the network by specifying layers of units
  and connections between layers.  You can then "program" the network by
  defining procedures that specify the way it should be activated, connections
  modified, etc.  The network specification language of PlaNet is general
  enough to allow for many different types of networks to be constructed.  It
  also includes high-level routines based on the back-propagation learning
  algorithm.

  Another important aspect of PlaNet is that it allows you to examine the
  state of the network through graphic display of various network states,
  such as activation patterns or weight matrices in the connecitons, and by
  plotting the learning curve (error or other network states as a function
  of learning cycles) in a graph.  ...
