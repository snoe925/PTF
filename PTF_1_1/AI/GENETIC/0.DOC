Description:	Genetic Algorithm Tools

Notes:

  Genetic Algorithms are search programs that borrow heavily from biological
  genetics.  That is, they encode parameters into "genes" (usually encoded
  as bit strings), generate and test sets of "individuals", then "breed" on
  a selective basis, using crossover, mutation, etc.

  Genetic Algorithms are finding increasing interest in solving optimization
  problems, particularly in cases where no effective algorithms or heuristics
  are known.  They are also being used in combination with other methods.
