Description:	GENESIS (GENEtic Search Impl. System)

Version:	5.0

Notes:
 
  This document describes the GENEtic Search Implementation System
  (GENESIS Version 5.0).  This system was written to promote the study of
  genetic algorithms for function minimization.  Since genetic algorithms
  are task independent optimizers, the user must provide only an
  "evaluation" function which returns a value when given a particular
  point in the search space.  The system is written in the language C.
  Details concerning the interface between the user-written function and
  GENESIS are explained below.  Makefiles are provided to ease the
  construction of genetic algorithms for the user's application.
 
  This version offers several enhancements over previous versions that
  should make the system much more user friendly.  The major improvement
  is a user-level representation that allows the user to think about the
  genetic structures as vectors of real numbers, rather than bit strings.
  This level of representation should make the application of GENESIS to
  new problems easier than ever.  A number of new options have been added,
  including: a display mode that includes an interactive user interface,
  the option to maximize or minimize the objective function, the choice of
  rank-based or proportional selection algorithm, and an option to use a
  Gray code as a transparent lower level representation.
