Notes:

  Artificial Intelligence (AI) tends to deal with problems for which there are
  no reliable algorithmic solutions.  Further, AI problems are likely to be
  somewhat domain-specific.  Consequently, generality, flexibility, and
  robustness are frequently valued more than polish or execution speed.
