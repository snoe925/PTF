Description:	atree - Adaptive Logic Network (ALN) sim.

Version:	2.0

Notes:

  You will probably have a lot of experience with backpropagation-type
  networks, so the thrust of the following remarks is to encourage you
  to see adaptive logic networks (ALNs) as a modification of that
  approach that could offer improved performance in some of your
  problems.  Certainly ALNs can help in problems that involve demanding
  real-time requirements or in situations where the available computing
  power is not adequate for a backpropagation network.

  First of all, you may not think of an adaptive logic network as a
  neural network at all, but it is!  In fact, an ALN is a special case
  of the familiar multilayer perceptron (MLP) feedforward network.
  There are just a few changes, all of them simplifications.  Briefly,
  the nodes (or elements) have (during training, at least) two input
  leads, the input signals x1, x2 are boolean ( 0 or 1), each connection
  weight is determined by a single bit of information, and the
  "squashing function" is a threshold.
